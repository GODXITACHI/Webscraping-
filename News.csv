"27 July, 2024","PIB fact-checks “microphone muted” claim by Mamata Banerjee, Nirmala Sitharaman says Bengal CM alloted due time at NITI Aayog meeting",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/centre-refutes-mama-banerjees-claim-that-she-was-not-allowed-to-speak-at-niti-aayog-meeting/,"A PIB fact check today debunked Mamata Banerjee’s allegations stating that ""only the clock showed that her speaking time was over.""The central government’s fact checking body on Saturday refuted as “misleading” the claim made by West Bengal chief minster about her microphone being switched off during a meeting of the NITI Aayog in the national capital on Saturday.A PIB fact check today debunked her allegations stating that “only the clock showed that her speaking time was over.”“It is being claimed that the microphone of CM, West Bengal was switched off during the 9th Governing Council Meeting of NITI Aayog. This claim is Misleading. The clock only showed that her speaking time was over. Even the bell was not rung to mark it,” the Press Information Bureau (PIB) said in a post on X.It is being claimed that the microphone of CM, West Bengal was switched off during the 9th Governing Council Meeting of NITI Aayog#PIBFactCheck ▶️ This claim is #Misleading ▶️ The clock only showed that her speaking time was over. Even the bell was not rung to mark it pic.twitter.com/P4N3oSOhBkMeanwhile, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told ANI that it is “completely false” of Mamata Banerjee to claim that her microphone was switched off and claimed that every chief minister at the meeting was “allotted their due time to speak.”“CM Mamata Banerjee attended the Niti Aayog meeting. We all heard her. Every CM was given the allotted time and that was displayed on the screen which was present before every table…She said in the media that her mic was put off. That is completely false, ” Sitharaman told ANI.“Every CM was given their due time to speak…It’s unfortunate that the chief minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee has claimed that her mic was switched off which is not true…She should speak the truth behind this rather than again build a narrative based on falsehood,” the Union Finance Minister said.According to the government fact check body PIB, Mamata Banerjee’s turn to speak would be only after lunch if one goes alphabetically but she was “accomodated” as the seventh speaker on an official request from the Chief Minister.“Alphabetically, CM, West Bengal turn would have come after lunch. She was accommodated as the 7th speaker on an official request of the West Bengal government as she had to return early,” PIB Fact Check explained in a subsequent tweet.Earlier today speaking to reporters, the West Bengal Chief Minister alleged “political discrimination” and said that at the NITI Aayog meeting she was not allowed to speak for more than five minutes while other chief ministers were given more time.“…I said you (central government) should not discriminate against state governments. I wanted to speak but my mic was muted. I was allowed to speak only for five minutes. People before me spoke for 10-20 minutes,” Banerjee told reporters after she stormed out of the NITI Aayog meeting today.“I was the only one from the opposition who was participating but still, I was not allowed to speak. This is insulting…,” Banerjee said as she walked out mid way from the meeting.“I have come out boycotting the NITI Aayog meeting. Chandrababu Naidu was given 20 minutes to speak, Chief Ministers of Assam, Goa, Chhattisgarh spoke for 10-12 minutes. I was stopped after just 5 minutes. This is unfair,” the Chief Minister said speaking to reporters after coming out of the meeting.Claiming that she had chosen to participate in the meeting to strengthen “cooperative federalism” Banerjee said, “There are many regional aspirations. That is why I am here, to share those aspirations. If a state is strong, the Union will be strong.”The Chief Minister said that several states, including West Bengal, were deprived in the Union Budget that was presented in Parliament this week,Asking the central government to treat states equally, Banerjee said, “Bengal has been deprived of MNREGA funds for the last three years, nothing was paid. Treat all states equally. I said that today. I am speaking on behalf of all the states which have been deprived.”Hitting out at the central government over the Budget, the Chief Minister said that the Centre does not support “cooperative federalism.”“From the Opposition side, I am here to strengthen cooperative federalism. But you are not for cooperative federalism. The Budget is totally politically biased. Why discriminate against other states?” Banerjee said.The Trinamool Congress supremo also asked the Centre to give financial powers to NITI Aayog or bring back the Planning Commission.“NITI Aayog has no financial powers, how will it work? Give it financial powers, or bring back the Planning Commission,” she said.Chief Ministers of opposition-led states including Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Telangana, Delhi and Punjab boycotted the NITI Aayog meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.On Wednesday, Chief Minister of Punjab Bhagwant Mann and Telangana Chief Minister Revanth Reddy said that their government will boycott the NITI Aayog in protest against the central government’s alleged injustice to the state in the allocation of funds in the 2024 Union Budget.(This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

Despite this, the cameraman kept filming without her consent.On Friday (26th July), BJP spokesperson Shazia Ilmi came down heavily on Rajdeep Sardesai after the latter accused her of ‘attacking’ the cameraman of the India Today group.Ilmi had left the primetime debate of the ‘propagandist masquerading as journalist’ half-way after he asked to cut off the mic of the BJP spokesperson. Despite this, the cameraman kept filming without her consent, leading to a physical altercation.In a tweet, Shazia Ilmi stated, “Don’t you ever bring down my Fader again. Remember I have been on both the sides and know how to handle bullies like you. BTW it doesn’t behove political propagandists masquerading as journalists to sermonise.”Ma’am, @shaziailmi I respect all my guests always. If anything, I am too indulgent: the fader is lowered only to avoid cross talk and noise on the show. If you have a grouse with me or with an army general on the show, of course that’s your prerogative. And I respect that too.… https://t.co/43atjurw75 pic.twitter.com/VjfmrrGWszRajdeep Sardesai was quick to play the ‘victim card’ and accuse the BJP spokesperson of assaulting the cameraman. “I respect all my guests always. If anything, I am too indulgent: the fader is lowered only to avoid cross talk and noise on the show. If you have a grouse with me or with an army general on the show, of course that’s your prerogative.

No excuse for bad behaviour. The rest I leave to you. Have a good weekend (the video below is from last night…” he continued.Sardesai had also shared a video of the physical altercation. Shazia Ilmi thanked the propagandist for providing video evidence and called out the ‘pervert’ cameraman for zooming on her chest. “Why on earth would I stay on your show when you humiliate me and say CUT SHAZIA’s Mike off ?

Why on earth would I stay on your show when you humiliate me and say CUT SHAZIA’s Mike off ? Only because I asked you whether you think all…The BJP spokesperson detailed the problematic behaviour of the cameraman, which forced her to evict him from her house. “Your cameraman watched me struggle as I got up and continued to film me trying to remove my mike, instead of helping me with the wheelchair. Why was he still continuing to focus on MY UPPER BODY showing it up close. It was so uncomfortable for me and I felt most embarrassed,” she pointed out.“Any lady would tell you that focussing on their chest is a clear NO NO. I could see this live on screen and requested him not to film me any or switch off the camera light. The pervert cameraman continued to film me despite my obvious physical and emotional discomfort after the show was over. Why ? Why would he keep filming him in my home, my SAFE place against my WILL? And that too, AFTER the show?” Shazia Ilmi asked.“Just because you’re a famous anchor (just as much you’re a sore loser) doesn’t mean you can humiliate people who call you out and force your crews on people , beyond the brief and violate their private space.

"27 July, 2024","As Bhim Army Chief Chandrashekhar Azad ‘Ravan’ pushes for private sector reservations, a look at the economic and social pitfalls of such a step",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/bhim-army-chief-chandrashekhar-azad-private-sector-reservations/,"The bill proposes that the Central government must incentivise private sector entities to implement reservations for SCs, STs, and OBCs by giving them special concessions and facilitating lower-interest loans through nationalised banks.On Friday (26th July), Azad Samaj Party MP from Uttar Pradesh’s Nagina and Bhim Army Chief, Chandra Shekhar Azad introduced a private member bill in Lok Sabha to extend reservations for the SCs, STs, and OBCs in the private sector. The bill is titled, ‘The Reservation for the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes and the Other Backward Classes in Private Sector Act, 2024’. आज मैने लोक सभा में 3 निम्नलिखित गैर सरकारी विधेयक पेश किए-1. निजी क्षेत्रों में अनुसूचित जातियों,अनुसूचित जनजातियों और अन्य पिछड़े वर्गों के लिये आरक्षण की व्यवस्था।2. अनुसूचित जातियों तथा अनुसूचित जनजातियों के बच्चों के लिये आवासीय स्कूल।3. देश मे सभी बालकों को उच्च एवम्… pic.twitter.com/25YDIPZ9ZwCurrently, reservations are only applicable in the public sector and there is no reservation in the private sector. The bill proposes to change this and extend reservation benefits to the SC, ST, and OBC communities in the private sector as well. The bill introduced by Bhim Army Chief Ravan seeks to extend reservations in the private sector, educational institutions, and other establishments that have no government financial interest and employ at least 20 people. The bill proposes that the Central government must incentivise private sector entities to implement reservations for SCs, STs, and OBCs by giving them special concessions and facilitating lower-interest loans through nationalised banks.It also proposes that the government should present an annual report in both houses of Parliament to highlight all actions that have been taken under the Act, in case it is passed by both houses as well as get Presidential assent. The proposed legislation also wants to make it mandatory for the Union government to frame rules to ensure the effective implementation of the Act (if passed). The bill claims to rely on support from Articles 16(4) and 16(4A) of the Constitution. Incidentally, the said article permits reservations in public sector undertakings (PSUs) and financial institutions receiving government grants.In his statement of objects and reasons, the Bhim Army Chief claimed that to ensure equitable growth and socio-economic upliftment, it is imperative to have representation from all sections of the society while highlighting the importance of the private sector in nation-building. Any Member of Parliament (MP) can also introduce proposed legislation in both houses of Parliament and it is known as the Private Members’ Bill. Just like any other bill proposed by the government, a Private Member bill, to become an act, must be passed by both houses and receive Presidential assent. Notably, such bills can only be introduced and discussed on Fridays. Yesterday (on 26th July), as many as 31 private members’ Bills were introduced in the Lok Sabha. Congress MP Shashi Tharoor also moved a private member bill seeking to reserve 10 seats in the Lok Sabha for those below 35 years of age.Today, I introduced three Private member’s bills in the Lok Sabha. One of them would reserve 10 seats in Parliament for people under the age of 35. We already hold the world record for the biggest gap between the average age of the population and the average age of Parliament. It… pic.twitter.com/T43PFDxkHTNonetheless, it is pertinent to note that while Bhim Army Chief Chandrashekhar Azad has proposed to extend reservations for SCs, STs, and OBCs in the private sector, the Congress government in Karnataka recently proposed to extend reservations in the private sector for Kannadigas. Strikingly, the Cabinet led by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah had decided to present seven bills, including 100% reservation for Kannadigas in Category C and D jobs in all private industries in the state. However, the legislation extending reservations in the private sector for Kannadigas triggered massive opposition from top Industry leaders and within the state government, forcing the state government to halt the proposed legislation for want of ‘further discussions’.Extending reservations, either for locals or the backward communities, in the private sector could have long-term and far-reaching consequences for the economy as well as the social fabric of the country. The proposed legislation would have a chilling effect on meritocracy, ease of doing business, and investment opportunities, as well as could lead to social unrest.As a well-established fact, India, or any other country plagued by Licence or quota raj, witnessed sluggish growth for several decades but it has grown leaps and bounds after the economic reforms in 1991 which liberalised the economy and unshackled private sector from needless legislative compliance. At a time when companies are opting out of China and relocating to countries that have skilled labour, stifling meritocracy for vote bank politics, and pushing reservations in the private sector would be catastrophic. This would not only be dragging India back in this highly competitive race of ‘free’ and open market access for new companies, it would be undoing the progress in economic and other key parameters of Human development post the liberalisation era. The strength of the private sector lies in the easy and flexible accessibility of factors of production, including skilled human resources. Barring the CSR aspect, the private sector links its outcomes with high standards of performance audits. However, with reservations in the private sector and elections always around the corner, companies would face mounting pressure from the ruling party in their state of operation to not fire employees despite audit reviews, as well as to improve recruitment from the communities forming political vote bank, thus putting a constraint on their say on Human resources.This has the potential to limit the functionality of companies causing them to find an exit route to ensure their profit margin and escape the wrath of the government’s and administration’s restrictive measures like the job quota compliance. The government/police intervention in the day-to-day functioning of the company’s operation to ensure compliance would render the companies prone to “corruption”, and “bureaucratic red-tapism”, and send the state/country back to the “License quota raj” period, pre-reform era.Furthermore, rather than striving to build an egalitarian society and uplift marginalised society, the bill’s introduction could lead to social unrest, like the protests during the Mandal era when reservations were made applicable only in the public sector which makes up roughly around 2% of the total workforce. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

The video of the shocking incident went viral on social media in which the latter can be heard asking the senior Congress leader to conclude as he exceeded the allotted time.Sharma requested, “Sixty-five people are scheduled to speak today. You have already spoken for 30 minutes,” to which he replied, “That doesn’t matter. Let the session continue till late.” Dhariwal then added, “Tum Kota ke ho b***c***. Kota mein rehna hai ke nahi rehna? (You are from Kota. Do you want to keep living in Kota or not),” as other members of the house laughed. Notably, Sharma is an MLA from South Kota.Arre tum Kota ke ho b#%* Kota me rehna hai ke nai tumhe: Congress MLA Shanti Dhariwal. pic.twitter.com/YuX7Tl173xShanti Dhariwal repeatedly used derogatory language in the legislative assembly. He made objectionable remarks in response to charges of wrongdoing during the Congress government and while talking on the issue of fake leases. When Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA from Nimbahera constituency Srichand Kripalani objected to his offensive utterances, he retorted, “Kripalani ji, You are my friend. Once you became a minister by mistake, you did not get the information. Now, listen to what I am saying and expand your knowledge.” BJP National Spokesperson Pratyush Kanth took to X (formerly Twitter) to slam the veteran Congressman and wrote, “This is senior Congress leader of Rajasthan, Shanti Dhariwal. He is threatening ‘Whether you want to stay in Kota or not, I will see,’ in the assembly. This is the honour of Congress for the post of Speaker which is a constitutional position. Their leaders in Delhi pretend to protect the Constitution. Will the Congress party take any action against him or will Jairam Ramesh only distance (party) from Dhariwal’s comment?”ये कांग्रेस राजस्थान के वरिष्ठ नेता शांति धारीवाल है।विधानसभा में धमकी दे रहे हैं कि आपको कोटा में रहना है या नहीं देख लेंगे।स्पीकर पद के लिए कांग्रेस का यह सम्मान जो की एक संवैधानिक पद है। दिल्ली में इनके नेता संविधान की रक्षा का ढोंग करते है।कांग्रेस पार्टी क्या इन पर कोई… pic.twitter.com/5d0Gni31WHShati Dhariwal has already drawn public ire for making a mockery of rape when he was serving as a cabinet minister in Ashok Gehlot’s administration in 2022. “Rajasthan has always been a region of manly persons. There is no doubt in the fact that we are at number one in rape cases. Why are we ahead in rape cases? Is there some fault within us? What can we do? Rajasthan has always been the state of ‘mards’ (men),” he expressed in the legislative assembly as other members received the vile remarks with laughs.The National Commission of Women (NCW) Chairperson, Rekha Sharma, had declared that the minister would face severe consequences. She stated, “Rajasthan Government has ministers like these that’s why women of the state are suffering gruesome gender crimes and police just don’t do anything. How will women of the state feel safe if it has ministers like these? NCW is taking strong action against Mr Dhariwal.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"25 July, 2024","Congress party distances itself from party MP and former Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi’s support to Khalistani MP Amripal Singh in Lok Sabha, says...",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/congress-party-distances-itself-from-its-mp-charanjit-singh-channis-support-to-khalistani-mp-amripal-singh-in-lok-sabha/,"Former Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi attacked the union govt in parliament for keeping Waris Punjab De chief and Khadoor Sahib Lok Sabha MP Amritpal Singh in jail. The Congress party has said that the comments made by party MP Charanjit Singh Channi in support of Khalistani MP Amirtpal Singh are his own and he does not represent the party’s views. Congress General Secretary in-charge Communications Jairam Ramesh posted a tweet distancing the party from Channi’s comments.“The views expressed by Charanjit Singh Channi, MP on Amritpal Singh are his own, and do not reflect in any way the position of the Indian National Congress,” Jairam Ramesh posted on X (Twitter).This comes after the former Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi attacked the union govt in parliament for keeping Waris Punjab De chief and Khadoor Sahib Lok Sabha MP Amritpal Singh in jail. Channi alleged that there is “undeclared emergency” under the Modi govt and claimed that “free speech” of the Khalistani leader was being curbed.Speaking during the debate on the Budget 2024, Charanjit Singh Channi said, “They (BJP) speak about Emergency every day. But what about the undeclared Emergency in the country today?…This too is Emergency that a man who was elected as an MP by 20 lakh people in Punjab is behind bars under the NSA. He is unable to present the views of the people of his constituency, here. This too is Emergency.”He alleged that there is an undeclared emergency in the nation while stating that Sidhu Moose Wala, one of the famous singers of the nation was killed and justice has not delivered to his family. Channi said, “Today in the country, a financial emergency-like condition is emerging and the BJP is responsible for that. They talk about the 1975 emergency but about today’s undeclared emergency in the country? It is also an emergency that Sidhu Moose Wala, one of the famous singers of the nation was killed and justice has not given to his family.”Notably, while Channi blamed the NDA govt at centre for Amritpal Singh’s arrest, the fact is Singh was arrested by Punjab Police and the NSA has been slapped against him by the Punjab govt run by AAP. Last month, the AAP govt in Punjab extended detention of Amritpal Singh and his nine aides, currently lodged in Dibrugarh Jail in Assam, by a year under the stringent National Security Act (NSA).The order was issued by Punjab government’s home affairs and justice department on 3rd June. Therefore, it is the Congress ally AAP govt which is keeping Amritpal Singh in jail, not the Modi govt at centre.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"25 July, 2024","The world remembers Akhlaq, but not Tejram: Here is how Tejram was lynched in Bareilly by a Muslim mob over stopping them from playing...",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/tejram-lynching-in-bareilly-by-a-muslim-mob-on-muharram-up-police-buldozer-action-stone-pelting-firing/,"The media bias contributes to the perpetuation of a narrative wherein Muslims are permanent victims while Hindus are disregarded. Furthermore, it denies victims equal respect and justice because their cases do not receive the attention and advocacy that would help in getting justice for Hindu victims.On Muharram this year, several incidents of mob violence and raising of slogans like ‘Sar tan se juda’ or ‘Hindustan mein rehna hai to Allah hu Akbar kehna hai” have been reported in various parts of India. However, there was no “idea of India khatre mein hai” or “lynchistan” type outrage on the ground or on social media. Why? Because the victims were Hindus and the perpetrators were Islamists. In Uttar Pradesh’s Bareilly district, an incident of mob lynching has been reported wherein a Hindu youth named Tejram was brutally lynched by a Muslim mob on 18th July after Hindus objected to Muslims playing “dhol” outside a Hindu temple during a Muharram procession on 17th July in Gausganj area.An altercation ensued over Hindus stopping Muslims from playing Dhol [drums] in front of a Hindu temple on 17th July during the Muharram procession. The accused Muslims then started attacking the Hindus and pelting stones at their houses and harassing the women. The ruckus had continued even after the arrival of the police. The Muslims later called more people from Rampur, CB Ganj, Mirganj, Devarniya and other neighbouring areas and attacked Hindu houses on the night of Friday with stones, sticks and other things.During the attack on Hindus by accused Muslims on the night of July 18th, Tejram sustained severe injuries on the head. An IndiaToday report said that some 80-100 persons arrived in the Gausganj neighbourhood and began pelting stones, breaking into houses, vandalising them, and beating up the residents. The villagers said that the Muslim attackers dragged Tejram from his house to the mosque and brutally thrashed the 26-year-old youth. Tejram’s family has said that he was attempting to defuse the matter. The Hindu youth was rushed to the hospital, however, Shahi Police Station in-charge Amit Kumar said that the victim succumbed to his injuries during treatment. Subsequently, the deceased victim’s body was sent for postmortem examination.The postmortem report mentions the brutality inflicted by the attackers during the lynching of Tejram. The report said that the skull bones of victim Tejram were damaged during the mob lynching as a result of strikes from large stones and iron rods, and blood clots had developed in his brain. While Tejram was trying to escape, his both hands and shoulders bleeding.After the mob violence, a case was then filed by the Hindu community against 50 identified individuals and 15 unidentified individuals. The Police eventually began an investigation into the case and arrested around 35 persons including Afsar Ali, Imran, Mukhtiar Ali, Abdul, Salam, and others. When police tried to arrest some accused, the accused had opened fire on police personnel too. The police had to open retaliatory fire. This resulted in injury to one of the accused identified as Alamgir. After this incident, one Najakat Ali was also arrested by the police. A constable was injured by shrapnel in the firing.On Tuesday (23rd July), the district administration of Uttar Pradesh’s Bareilly razed over nine houses belonging to the Muslim accused in the case. Before this, the administration demolished 11 buildings belonging to the accused persons after finding that they constructed houses on Gram Samaj’s government land. During the demolition drive, the house of the main accused Bakhtawar was also razed to the ground. In addition, the illegal houses of accused Babu, Hasan Ali, Kader Ali, Hanif, Haseen, and Riyasat have also been marked for demolition.थाना शाही क्षेत्रान्तर्गत ग्राम गौसगंज में दिनांक 19.07.2024 को घटित घटना के सम्बन्ध में पंजीकृत अभियोगो में 35 अभियुक्तों की गिरफ्तार आदि की कार्यवाही होने के सम्बन्ध में पुलिस अधीक्षक दक्षिणी बरेली की बाइट।#UPPolice pic.twitter.com/BeJjVLJAvgDo you remember Akhlaq? Do you remember Pehlu Khan? Yes, you do! These names have been etched in your memory since the entire media, left-liberal ecosystem and political vultures made sure you do, and feel “ashamed as a Hindu” and guilty. A mere mention of these two names refreshes one’s memory of how the anti-Hindu cabal and placard gang berated Hindustan as “lynchistan” to assert that somehow the Muslim ‘minority’ is no longer safe under the Modi-led ‘Hindutva’ government.When incidences like the alleged lynching of Akhlaq in 2015 and cow smuggler Pehlu Khan occurred in 2017, there was massive criticism, media coverage, and outrage from a variety of sources, including liberals and self-proclaimed ‘human rights’ activists. Akhlaq’s lynching, in which he was suspected of storing beef, became a national issue, sparking debates about intolerance and mob violence in India against ‘minorities’ even as it turned out that while Akhlaq’s family had claimed the meat in question was mutton, the final report on the same confirmed it was from a cow. However, similar outrage and attention appear to be non-existent in the case of the lynching of Tejaram since he was a Hindu lynched by those belonging to an ‘oppressed’ minority. A man named Tabrez beaten to death in Jharkhand in 2019 over allegations of theft sparked more outrage than over a Hindu youth who spoke for his community being lynched by Muslims. While news anchors conducted primetime debates to peddle the ‘darr ka mahaul’ narrative, long op-eds were written by anti-Hindu pens for hire in Indian and Western media passing off incidents of violence over cattle smuggling allegations as the lynching of Muslims by ‘Hindutva’ mobs, there is deafening ‘secular’ silence over the horrific lynching of Tejaram in Bareilly. Except for a few journalists, the mainstream media which takes delight in preaching to Hindus how they are becoming ‘intolerant’, is absolutely mum over a Hindu man’s lynching by Muslims, and incidents involving the raising of murderous ‘Sar tan se juda’ slogans during Muharram processions. You will not see primetime debates with ‘experts’ discussing where the country is heading.If you have not heard about Teja Ram’s brutal lynching by Islamists on Moharram, I don’t blame you. “Secular silence”, as @AmanChopra_ puts it, is very real. Have a look at how the news is blacked out totally even by Google. pic.twitter.com/Zu7383W13oWhile Hindus have the least expectations from biased media publications, their silence on incidents of religiously motivated violence against Hindus is dangerous. Their silence contributes to the normalisation of anti-Hindu violence. If narrative building is an art, Islamists and their media allies are its Picasso. On the one hand, Islamists and Muslim ‘journalists’ stir outrage even by peddling fake ‘mob lynching by Hindus’ narrative over incidents wherein the deceased happens to be a Muslim with no communal angle whatsoever, on the other, incidents of violence against Hindus do not get enough attention forget outrage and even the media forgets such incidents after one or two short articles or mentioning them in ‘100 fatafat’ news on television.The media bias contributes to the perpetuation of a narrative wherein Muslims are permanent victims while Hindus are disregarded. Furthermore, it denies victims equal respect and justice because their cases do not receive the attention and advocacy that would help in getting justice for Hindu victims. Apparently, the biased media and Hindu-hating political parties have successfully established the narrative that there are two types of mob lynching: one is “communal lynching” wherein the victim happens to be a Muslim regardless of the existence of any communal angle or not, and the other is “secular lynching” wherein Hindus are the victims of mob violence by Muslims. They have managed to convince the public that somehow only alleged ‘communal lynching’ is worth street protests, candle marches, social media outrage, primetime debates, celebrities crying ‘Not my India’ etc. It seems that the incidents of anti-Hindu violence are being deliberately downplayed to convince the Hindus that only the Muslim ‘minority’ can be victims and since Hindus are the majority community they are by default the oppressors.Just imagine the outrage had Tejram’s name been Tabarez and it was the occasion of Ram Navami or Hanuman Jayanti instead of Muharram. Notably, in what seems like a deliberate cover-up, most mainstream media reports did not even mention that Tejaram was lynched allegedly inside a mosque. No wonder, the killers of Kamlesh Tiwari get bail while the deceased Hindu is forgotten while death anniversaries of cow smugglers and cow meat hoarders are observed by Islamists every year. The short-term memory of Hindus further helps them in downplaying anti-Hindu violence and whitewashing the crimes of Islamists as well as using the desperation of Hindus to hold moral high ground to guilt trip them over incidents wherein the deceased happens to be Muslim. Hindus are definitely losing the narrative battle despite being persecuted while Islamists, with the help of their media allies and politicians continue to control the narrative and even influence elections by playing perpetual victimhood. So far, the cases of grooming jihad [also called love jihad] are dismissed as ‘fiction’, ‘hoax’ and ‘conspiracy theory’, soon the cases of anti-Hindu violence will also be given similar tags.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"23 July, 2024","Milords, you had a choice to eat in a restaurant you like, we want the same choice and clarity while making a purchase",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/supreme-court-stay-order-up-uttarakhand-street-vendor-eatery-name-display/,"Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing the petitioners further contended that the display of the name itself cannot be seen as a measure to ensure vegetarian food. Furthermore, any such directive coming without any support from the Constitutional or legal provisions would infringe the secular character and Articles 14, 15(1) and 17 of the Constitution.On 22nd July, the Supreme Court of India gave interim relief to the petitioners against the Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand governments’ directives to prominently display the names of the owners of the shop and carts. While Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand governments issued directives for the Kanwar Yatra Path, Madhya Pradesh’s Ujjain administration gave directives for the shops and carts outside the Mahakal Temple.During the argument, an interesting trivia came to light. The matter was heard by Justice Hrishikesh Roy and Justice SVN Bhatti. It was mentioned by Justice Bhatti that he used to go to a vegetarian hotel operated by a Muslim over the one operated by a Hindu citing ‘hygiene standards’.He said, “Without disclosing the city’s name I will share it with you. In Kerala, there were two vegetarian hotels, one by Hindu and one by Muslim. I went to the latter because he was maintaining international standards. He was a Dubai returnee. But he displayed everything on the board.” [The quote is a mix of X posts made by Live Law and Bar & Bench]Singhvi: Hundreds are losing their jobs. We have to wake up and smell the coffee. Idea is to exclude not just one minority but Dalits as well.Justice Roy: What is the expectation of the Kanwariyas? They worship Shiva, yes? Do they expect the food to be cooked and served and…In short, Justice Bhatti made a firm choice based on the information displayed on a board to choose a Muslim hotelier over a Hindu hotelier because the former was maintaining “International Standards” of hygiene. Justice Bhatti had the choice of selecting the hotelier with a complete set of information including his religion.J Bhatti: There is one veg hotel run by a Hindu, and one run by a Muslim…in Kerala…As the judge of that state, I used to go the one run by the Muslim. He was maintaining international standards#SupremeCourt #KanwarYatraNow the question arises, if Justice Bhatti can have the choice and clarity while choosing the restaurant, why did the two-judge bench, which he was part of, deny the same right to Hindu pilgrims performing Kanwar Yatra? For those who are unaware, devotees performing Kanwar Yatra are supposed to eat only Satvik food. They must follow certain rules which they may break in case enough information is not available.The interim stay imposed by the Supreme Court was based on the contention that the directives were “discriminatory” and would cause untouchability. Interestingly, on social media, it has been argued that Kanwariyas would also avoid eating at restaurants run by Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes OBCs etc. One may ask what proof or evidence they provided. The answer is none.Anyway, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing the petitioners further contended that the display of the name itself cannot be seen as a measure to ensure vegetarian food. Furthermore, any such directive coming without any support from the Constitutional or legal provisions would infringe the secular character and Articles 14, 15(1) and 17 of the Constitution. While these contentions were accepted by the apex court, there was no thought of mind implying the fact that Hindus too have the right to choose where they want to eat or buy anything.Furthermore, while discussing the above aspects, Justice Bhatti also mentioned that “some non-vegetarians” prefer Halal-certified meat. Halal is a religious term used for meat produced as per Sharia law or Islamic laws. Only a Muslim can ensure the meat is Halal. Judges were aware that food choices are prominently dependent on religion. Without taking the name of the Muslims, Justice Bhatti pointed out that Muslims make an informed choice to choose Halal meat over Jhatka or unlabelled. How do they know that the meat is Halal? Meat shop owners mention it in bold letters.Justice Bhatti: We understand the distinction between good and bad here. Some non-vegetarians prefer halal certified meat. What I see is that you previously mentioned you couldn’t answer my brother’s question with a simple yes or no.AM Singhvi: It is mostly yes. They have…Halal meat is so widely available and has become the first choice of famous food chains that it is extremely difficult for Hindus and Sikhs to find Jhatka meat. They have to make extra effort to ask if the meat is Jhatka or not. As Halal meat is butchered only by a Muslim, it leads to a loss of jobs for Hindu and Sikh butchers. Only a few Butchers of Hindu or Sikh community are left but it has never been questioned. Hindus are in majority in India. The population of meat-eating Hindus surpass Muslims. Still, Hindus are forced intentionally or unintentionally to eat Halal meat. In this case, what about the rights of Hindus? Are they not valid?One needs two hands to clap. Certain rules about dietary habits and choices cannot be imposed continuously in a biased manner favouring only one community. Hindus must get the right to choose where they want to eat and from whom they want to buy fruits or any other item. It has to be based on the information publically available, preferably prominently written on boards outside shops and carts.There is another aspect of the order. The Supreme Court pointed out that a competent food authority should have passed the order in the matter. The court said, “It is permissible for the authorities to ensure that the Kanwariyas are served vegetarian food conforming to the preferences and also ensure hygienic standards. In furtherance to this, the competent authority may perhaps issue orders under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 and the Street Vendors Act, 2014. However, the legal powers vested on the competent authority cannot be usurped by the Police, without legal foundation.” In short, if FSSAI issues directive to prominently display names of the owners and workers at the restaurant or carts, the apex court will not have a problem with it. Sadly, there was no one from any of the three governments, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand, to represent the matter in the Supreme Court even though all three governments have counsels on payroll in the apex court. The next date of hearing in the matter is 26th July.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

"23 July, 2024","Innocence exploited – How NewsLaundry lied and defamed Hindu activist Bittu Bajrangi, who spoke to them in good faith",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/newslaundry-lied-defamed-hindu-bittu-bajrangi-spoke-to-them-in-good-faith-nuh-violence/,"While granting bail to Bittu, the court noted, “It has nowhere been pointed out that as to whether these weapons were being used to cause violence on the spot or to inflict any injury either to the policemen or to any people of a particular community. No such allegations are there. Snatching of such articles/weapons from the policemen is also highly improbable.” Bittu Bajrangi was accused under sections 148, 149, 332, 353, 186, 395, 397, 506, 25, 54, and 59 of the IPC in connection with the Nuh violence incident.On Saturday, 20th July, propaganda portal Newslaundry published a video interview with Gaurakshak Bajrang Force chief Bittu Bajrangi. While speaking to Bittu, Newslaundry’s reporter Avdesh Kumar spoke to him politely but the agenda with which he approached the interview was sinister.Violence broke out in Nuh during a jalabhishek yatra in July last year, killing six people. Key accused Bittu Bajrangi is set to lead the same yatra today.Catch the cow vigilante in conversation with @ImAvdheshkumar: https://t.co/Mlmg1HouAB pic.twitter.com/drH6xJ1h93The title of the video interview reads, “The main accused of Nuh riots and out on bail Bittu Bajrangi to organize Jalabhishek Yatra again”. The description of the video, which was in Hindi, read, “Bittu Bajrangi, the main accused in the violence that occurred on July 31 last year, is personally inviting people to participate in this procession. We spoke to Bittu Bajrangi in detail about this matter. It should be noted that the violence in Nuh, Haryana, last year created a climate of concern across the state and the country. This violence occurred during a religious procession when a minor dispute between two communities suddenly escalated. Six people lost their lives, and many were injured in the violence.”The description further read, “Bittu Bajrangi, known as a Gau Rakshak, was prominently implicated in this incident. He also runs an organization called Gau Raksha Bajrang Force. Last year, he was arrested on charges of inciting violence and playing an active role in it. The police and administration considered him one of the main accused. Bittu Bajrangi participated in the religious procession during which the violence started. He is accused of inciting his supporters and encouraging them to engage in violent activities. Immediately after the violence, Bittu Bajrangi was taken into police custody, and multiple charges were filed against him. He is currently out on bail.”OpIndia talked to Bittu Bajrangi to get his views on the title and description. He said, “I am heartbroken. I will be vigilant next time before agreeing to an interview”. From his statement, it is evident that he was unaware of how he was going to be presented in the video.No one is denying that there are several cases filed against Bittu Bajrangi, especially linked to his Gau Raksha work. However, in this case, Newslaundry has presented him as if he was the one solely responsible for the Nuh violence that took place on 31st July 2023. OpIndia accessed court documents, including his bail orders by the Sessions Court. There was no mention that he was the main accused. As the order read, Usha [Kundu], HPS Additional Superintendent of Police, Nuh, was posted on the day of the incident. She noticed Bittu and his accomplices coming towards the temple to join the procession.She pointed out in her complaint that Bittu and his accomplices were carrying swords and Trishul-like weapons which were confiscated by the police. After the police confiscated the swords and Trishul, Bittu and his accomplices got into an altercation with the police and staged a protest by sitting on the road in front of the police vehicle. It was then alleged that they forcefully took the weapons away. Defense counsel appearing for Bittu argued that the alleged weapons were just symbols that were carried for display.  While granting bail to Bittu, the court noted, “It has nowhere been pointed out that as to whether these weapons were being used to cause violence on the spot or to inflict any injury either to the policemen or to any people of a particular community. No such allegations are there. Snatching of such articles/weapons from the policemen is also highly improbable.” Bittu Bajrangi was accused under sections 148, 149, 332, 353, 186, 395, 397, 506, 25, 54, and 59 of the IPC in connection with the Nuh violence incident.It was nowhere mentioned in the FIR that Bittu Bajrangi used the weapons or inflicted any injuries on police personnel or people of a particular community.Notably, a trial in the matter has started in the Sessions court and a non-bailable warrant was issued against Bittu as he failed to appear in court via video conferencing. His counsel argued there was some miscommunication but NBW was issued by the court. However, that still does not prove that he played any role in the violence.Newslaundry’s description lacks facts. They mentioned that six people were killed but did not mention what was the reason behind it. Newslaundry failed to mention that a Hindu boy named Abhishek was shot dead and then beheaded by an Islamist mob. Abhishek’s head was then crushed with a stone. Newslaundry did not make a video explaining how an Islamist mob attacked a cybercrime police station or how a female judge was attacked during the violence by the Islamist mob when she was traveling with her daughter. Shops of Hindus were burnt to the ground, Hindu pilgrims were made hostages in a temple, and police personnel and home guards were killed by the riotous Islamist mob. This is how propaganda works and Newslaundry is an expert in it.As mentioned earlier, no one is denying the cases against Bittu. He mentioned that there are around eight cases currently pending against him and he has been in and out of jail over such cases. But that does not nullify the fact that he has tirelessly worked for the welfare of the Hindu community including Gau Raksha. While propaganda portals do not skip a breath before mentioning terrorists like Afzal Guru as a professor or riot-accused Umar Khalid as a “student activist”, when it comes to Hindu activists like Bittu, they present them as no less than terrorists, while hiding the crimes of the Islamists against which those like Bittu Bajrangi act in defense. Hundreds and thousands of Hindu activists are misrepresented by the left-leaning media which often distorts their intentions and work. Take the example of this interview. The NL reporter kept pressing Bittu to “reveal” his political affiliation. Bittu pointed out that he works independently without any political affiliation or “sar par haath” per se.Kumar kept asking if he was associated with RSS, BJP, or VHP. Bittu clearly said that he is inspired by these organizations and attached to them in one way or another. When the reporter said VHP has “disowned” him, Bittu said, “When a family member does something wrong, the elders of the family say in anger ‘he is not part of our family’. That does not necessarily mean that the person who did wrong has been disowned”. The argument visibly rattled the reporter, and he changed his course of questions.From the use of foul language to alleged derogatory social media posts, Kumar did not leave any stone unturned to agitate Bittu during the interview. Bittu at one point said, “I am a very calm person who does not use foul language. However if someone acts against the Hindu community, I may get angry”. He admitted he gets angry but that does not mean he uses foul language every time he speaks, something which Newslaundry’s reporter wanted to present.What could be the aim of such an interview that too just a couple of days before the scheduled Brijmandal Yatra? The aim was simple. Newslaundry wanted to set a narrative that Bittu Bajrangi was the key accused and reason for Nuh’s violence last year. In case anything happens during the 2024 Yatra, the blame would have again gone to Hindu activists. Unfortunately for Newslaundry and fortunately for Bittu, he was not granted permission to attend Yatra. It was one of his bail conditions that he would not visit Nuh until the trial was over, which could have led to the denial of the permission, this, despite there being no proof of his involvement in any violence during the Nuh Yatra, and there being plenty of evidence of the violence unleashed by the Muslim mob.One can only hope nothing happens during the ongoing Brijmandal Yatra as 5,000 police personnel have been deployed by the Haryana government to avoid any sort of agitation or violence. In a country where Hindus are supposedly a majority, they need protection from the police (in the case of Brijmandal Yatra) and the Army (in the case of Amarnath Yatra) to participate in a pilgrimage which speaks volumes about the reality of the situation.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"22 July, 2024",Mamata Banerjee and her unhealthy obsession with not being a kafir and ‘fighting kafirs’: Here’s how she peddled the dangerous line earlier,https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/mamata-banerjee-her-unhealthy-obsession-with-not-being-a-kafir-and-fighting-kafirs/,"CM Banerjee said: “Jo darte hai wo marte hai, Jo ladte hai wo Kamyab hote hai, hum darpok nhi hai, hum kafir nhi hai, hum gaddar nhi hai.” (Translation – Those who get scared end up losing, while those who put up a fight achieve victory, we are not cowards, we are not kafir.)“What Bengal thinks today India thinks tomorrow”: This popular saying of freedom fighter Gopal Krishna Gokhale boasted Bengal’s cultural and intellectual richness, in the present context sounds no less than a “warning”. Imagine a sitting Chief Minister using a pejorative term used by a religious community to dehumanise others to boast about her bravery. Well, you don’t need to imagine, since this is the new normal, the new reality of West Bengal. On the 21st of July, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee while speaking at TMC’s ‘Martyr’s Day’ event said that she is not a Kafir and went on to equate Kafirs with cowards. CM Banerjee said: “Jo darte hai wo marte hai, Jo ladte hai wo Kamyab hote hai, hum darpok nhi hai, hum kafir nhi hai, hum gaddar nhi hai.” (Translation – Those who get scared end up losing, while those who put up a fight achieve victory, we are not cowards, we are not kafir.)Such desperation to prove her pro-Muslim credentials that Mamata Banerjee, voted and elected as the state’s representative by people of various religious communities, ended up declaring all of them except Muslims as “Kafirs” [infidels] and cowards.It is pertinent to understand, especially for those labelled as “Kafirs” what exactly the term means before delving into why it is outrageous for a ‘democratic’ leader holding a constitutional post to use this jibe against her political adversaries.“The word Kufr means to reject faith in God, God’s signs, the prophets, the Holy Scriptures and the Day of Judgment. One who does not have faith in the unity of God and does not have faith also in other sacred signs of God is a Kafir, according to the Quran. One who rejects faith in God or does not have faith in God is called a Kafir. A Kafir may also be an idolater who worships gods and goddesses. According to the Quran, they are those who have gone astray. There are about 350 verses about Kufr and Kafir. In the majority of the verses, Kufr is non-belief in one God and prophets of God and the Holy Scriptures. Kufr is also worship of idols and gods and goddesses other than God. In some of the verses, the word Kufr and its variations are used to mean ingratitude for the favours of God. It is natural that if someone does not recognize God or does not have faith in God, he will also not acknowledge God’s favours but will attribute the favours to his gods and goddesses,” this is how New Age Islam, an Islamic reformist organisation describes Kufr and Kafir. Here God without an “s” is used for Allah.In a country where millions of Hindus who are polytheists and worship their deities using idols reside, a Chief Minister finds “Kafir” the most appropriate term to attack her political rivals. This, however, is not the first and certainly not going to be the last time Banerjee used this slur against non-Muslims.On 22nd January 2024, the day Prime Minister Narendra Modi performed the Pran Pratishtha of Ramlala at Ayodhya Ram Mandir, a historic day of reclamation for Hindus, Mamata Banerjee issued a stern warning to those who support or vote for BJP saying that Allah will not forgive them and that only Kafirs fear, but those who fight they win. “Ek bat yaad rakhna, BJP ko madad mat karna, BJP ko agar tum log madad karoge koi to Allah ki kasam aap logo ko koi mafi nhi karega hum to mafi nhi karenge.” (Translated – Do remember one thing, don’t support/assist/vote for BJP. I am swearing on Allah if you help/assist BJP, nobody would forgive you, let alone me.) “Jo Kafir hain, woh darte hain, Jo ladte hain, woh jeet te hain,” Banerjee said.Irony died a painful death as Mamata Banerjee made these remarks at a ‘Sarv Dharm Sambhav’ rally.Similarly, in May 2022, a video of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee went viral on social media where she was addressing the crowd on the occasion of Eid. During her address, she said something that sounded like ‘Kafir’. She said, “Let them do what they want. We are not scared. We are not cowards. We are not ‘Kafir’ [possibly]. We fight. We know how to fight. We will fight against them. We will finish them.”Who would have thought that the idea of respecting all religions emanates from labelling non-Muslims as Kafirs and cowards? The Quran and Islamic scholars say that anyone who does not believe in Allah, his messenger and the judgement day is a Kafir and his ‘sins’ are unforgivable. These Kafirs, who do not believe in Allah become Mushrikeens when they worship Gods other than Allah.Islamic terrorists and ‘unarmed’ Islamists often use the term “Kafir” to subjugate Hindus and other non-Muslims as well as to justify their violent attacks on ‘infidels’.Banerjee’s usage of ‘Kafir’ goes beyond mere political jabs. It is a potent symbol of religious exclusion and conflict. CM Banerjee’s choice of words is not incidental but rather a deliberate strategy to solidify her support base among Muslims by framing political battles in religious terms. The Trinamool Congress supremo knows that making such opprobrious remarks won’t trigger protests of the same intensity if anyone said something slightly critical about Muslims. The streets of India have witnessed widespread protests, effigy-burnings and violence over a Hindu woman and BJP’s former spokesperson Nupur Sharma for merely stating facts often mentioned by Islamic scholars and the Islamic texts.Mamata Banerjee’s statements during such public events suggest that she is fighting against ‘Kafirs,’ positioning herself and her supporters as the true believers against an opposing ‘other.’ This language feeds into a larger narrative of religious and cultural conflict, which is particularly dangerous in a multi-religious society like India where the peaceful Hindu majority is perpetually subjected to scrutiny for their religious beliefs and customs, gaslighting in the event Muslims get offended over Hindus celebrating their festivals like Ram Navami in ‘Muslim areas’ and resort to stone pelting and violence. CM Banerjee’s statements alienate Hindus by casting them as the ‘cowards and infidels’ fostering a sense of exclusion and division in the land of Hindus, in the land of Swami Vivekanand.While framing political opponents as ‘Kafirs’ promotes intolerance and bigotry against Hindus and other non-Muslims in addition to dehumanising them, this bigotry has been mainstreamed in the TMC-ruled state. OpIndia has reported several incidents wherein the state government demonstrated its blatant favouritism towards Muslims and disdain towards Hindus. It was reported last year, that a Durga Mandir was found blocked and barricaded in Kaliachak town in Malda district of West Bengal. The development came a day before the Islamic month of Muharram. Before this, CM Mamata Banerjee imposed restrictions on the immersion of Durga idols in 2016 and 2017 to make way for Muharram processions. The burden of upholding the farcical ‘secularism’ lies on the shoulders of Hindus, since the state itself makes it a matter of “Us vs Kafirs” and deems Kafirs as cowards. Just imagine the outrage liberals and Islamists would unleash if a BJP leader says he/she is not a coward or not a Mleccha.While there are numerous incidents, let’s discuss a recent incident to understand how the Islamisation of West Bengal is being normalised unchecked. TMC leader and a Cabinet Minister in the state government, Firhad Hakim derided non-Muslims as ‘unfortunate’ and openly called for their religious conversion to Islam. “Those who were not born into Islam were born with misfortune. If we can give them Dawat (call for proselytization) and bring Iman (Faith) in them, then, we will make Allah happy. We need to spread Islam among non-Muslims. If we can bring someone on the path of Islam, then, we will prove to be true Muslims by ensuring the spread of Faith,” said Firhad Hakim who is also Mamata Banerjee’s close aide.When a state minister openly gives the call for converting ‘unfortunate’ non-Muslims to Islam to make his God happy, Mamata Banerjee calling BJP leaders or non-Muslims in general Kafirs is not shocking. Hakim has earlier called for the “Urduisation” of Bengal. In addition, he once called BJP leaders and the Central Armed Forces “Suar ke bacche” [progeny of pig]. It is widely known that Muslims despise pigs and even eating pork is considered “haram” in Islam.No wonder a TMC MLA Hamidul Rahman’s alleged close associate Tajemul Haque alias JCB holds an ‘Insaf Sabha’ brutally assaults a woman in public and the TMC MLA justifies this Taliban-style flogging by saying that there are some ‘codes’ in a ‘Muslim Rashtra’. Apparently, in their heads and actions, the Islamists and their cheerleaders have already assumed West Bengal to be an ‘Islamic nation’ and it seems only an official declaration is awaited.Even before declaring her political opponents as “Kafirs”, Mamata Banerjee had selected 16th August to observe ‘Khela Hobe Diwas’, the day which coincided with ‘Direct Action Day’ to launch her campaign to remove BJP from power in various states ahead of the elections. CM Banerjee had then said that the “Khela Hobe” slogan would now be used on the national stage and declared that “Khela” would now happen in all states until the BJP is removed from the country.Incidentally, 16th August is the day when Muhammad Ali Jinnah called on Muslims throughout India to observe the Direct Action Day, also known as the 1946 Calcutta Killings, when thousands of Hindus were butchered by Islamists of the Muslims Leagues on the streets of Kolkata. Two months after the Trinamool Congress (TMC) swept the West Bengal State Legislative polls, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee announced to commemorate her election slogan in the form of ‘Khela Hobe Diwas‘.Mocking Hindus, dehumanising political opponents using Islamist slurs, and warning people that Allah will not forgive them, West Bengal under the TMC government has become opposed to its vibrant cultural identity.Mamata Banerjee’s repeated use of the term ‘Kafir’ is not just a political statement but a significant threat to the social fabric of India. It reflects an unhealthy obsession with religious identity and an attempt to appease the Muslim voter base at the cost of broader societal cohesion. As the Chief Minister, her responsibility should be to unite the people of West Bengal and address their collective needs rather than resorting to such polarising tactics. This desperation to prove to the Muslim vote bank that she is one of their own and others are ‘Kafir’, does not exemplify her ‘secular’ mindset but the extent to which the TMC is willing to go to retain power. On one hand, Mamata Banerjee randomly recites Chandi Paath to fool Hindus on the other, exposing her Islamist sympathising mindset. This mindset is no different from Islamic terrorists who want to subjugate non-Muslims to turn India into a Dar-ul-Islam.Ironically, from calling opponents Kafirs, Hindus “Hinsak” [violent] to calling Sanatan Dharma as “Dengue, Malaria” and calling for its eradication, the opposition parties and their leaders are deemed ‘defenders’ of Indian democracy and ‘idea of India’ and champions of constitution while the party following and respecting the democratic processes without slandering any religious community is labelled as ‘fascist, communal, bigot, and whatnot by the opposition friendly pens for hire and the extended ‘ecosystem’.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"27 July, 2024","PIB fact-checks “microphone muted” claim by Mamata Banerjee, Nirmala Sitharaman says Bengal CM alloted due time at NITI Aayog meeting",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/centre-refutes-mama-banerjees-claim-that-she-was-not-allowed-to-speak-at-niti-aayog-meeting/,"A PIB fact check today debunked Mamata Banerjee’s allegations stating that ""only the clock showed that her speaking time was over.""The central government’s fact checking body on Saturday refuted as “misleading” the claim made by West Bengal chief minster about her microphone being switched off during a meeting of the NITI Aayog in the national capital on Saturday.A PIB fact check today debunked her allegations stating that “only the clock showed that her speaking time was over.”“It is being claimed that the microphone of CM, West Bengal was switched off during the 9th Governing Council Meeting of NITI Aayog. This claim is Misleading. The clock only showed that her speaking time was over. Even the bell was not rung to mark it,” the Press Information Bureau (PIB) said in a post on X.It is being claimed that the microphone of CM, West Bengal was switched off during the 9th Governing Council Meeting of NITI Aayog#PIBFactCheck ▶️ This claim is #Misleading ▶️ The clock only showed that her speaking time was over. Even the bell was not rung to mark it pic.twitter.com/P4N3oSOhBkMeanwhile, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told ANI that it is “completely false” of Mamata Banerjee to claim that her microphone was switched off and claimed that every chief minister at the meeting was “allotted their due time to speak.”“CM Mamata Banerjee attended the Niti Aayog meeting. We all heard her. Every CM was given the allotted time and that was displayed on the screen which was present before every table…She said in the media that her mic was put off. That is completely false, ” Sitharaman told ANI.“Every CM was given their due time to speak…It’s unfortunate that the chief minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee has claimed that her mic was switched off which is not true…She should speak the truth behind this rather than again build a narrative based on falsehood,” the Union Finance Minister said.According to the government fact check body PIB, Mamata Banerjee’s turn to speak would be only after lunch if one goes alphabetically but she was “accomodated” as the seventh speaker on an official request from the Chief Minister.“Alphabetically, CM, West Bengal turn would have come after lunch. She was accommodated as the 7th speaker on an official request of the West Bengal government as she had to return early,” PIB Fact Check explained in a subsequent tweet.Earlier today speaking to reporters, the West Bengal Chief Minister alleged “political discrimination” and said that at the NITI Aayog meeting she was not allowed to speak for more than five minutes while other chief ministers were given more time.“…I said you (central government) should not discriminate against state governments. I wanted to speak but my mic was muted. I was allowed to speak only for five minutes. People before me spoke for 10-20 minutes,” Banerjee told reporters after she stormed out of the NITI Aayog meeting today.“I was the only one from the opposition who was participating but still, I was not allowed to speak. This is insulting…,” Banerjee said as she walked out mid way from the meeting.“I have come out boycotting the NITI Aayog meeting. Chandrababu Naidu was given 20 minutes to speak, Chief Ministers of Assam, Goa, Chhattisgarh spoke for 10-12 minutes. I was stopped after just 5 minutes. This is unfair,” the Chief Minister said speaking to reporters after coming out of the meeting.Claiming that she had chosen to participate in the meeting to strengthen “cooperative federalism” Banerjee said, “There are many regional aspirations. That is why I am here, to share those aspirations. If a state is strong, the Union will be strong.”The Chief Minister said that several states, including West Bengal, were deprived in the Union Budget that was presented in Parliament this week,Asking the central government to treat states equally, Banerjee said, “Bengal has been deprived of MNREGA funds for the last three years, nothing was paid. Treat all states equally. I said that today. I am speaking on behalf of all the states which have been deprived.”Hitting out at the central government over the Budget, the Chief Minister said that the Centre does not support “cooperative federalism.”“From the Opposition side, I am here to strengthen cooperative federalism. But you are not for cooperative federalism. The Budget is totally politically biased. Why discriminate against other states?” Banerjee said.The Trinamool Congress supremo also asked the Centre to give financial powers to NITI Aayog or bring back the Planning Commission.“NITI Aayog has no financial powers, how will it work? Give it financial powers, or bring back the Planning Commission,” she said.Chief Ministers of opposition-led states including Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Telangana, Delhi and Punjab boycotted the NITI Aayog meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.On Wednesday, Chief Minister of Punjab Bhagwant Mann and Telangana Chief Minister Revanth Reddy said that their government will boycott the NITI Aayog in protest against the central government’s alleged injustice to the state in the allocation of funds in the 2024 Union Budget.(This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

In Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, a helpless farmer kept making rounds of government offices, but his plea was not heard anywhere. At some places bribe was demanded and at other places people were sent away without any hearing. Ultimately, fed up, the farmer was forced to take this step. It is a well known fact that BJP and Narendra Modi are anti-farmer, it has been proved again today,” Congress posted.Shankarlal, dressed in a worn-out dhoti, was spotted rolling on the floor of the Collectorate office with his hands folded, muttering, “What should we do now?” as officials and visitors looked on.The old farmer claimed that despite numerous complaints, no action had been taken. He said that the alleged “inaction” of the officials prompted him to roll in the Collectorate’s halls to draw attention towards his plight. “A local land mafia is troubling me. The Tehsildar makes a mistake, and the farmer suffers. They make the mistakes, and I suffer the consequences. I am unhappy with the government and the administration. The officers here are corrupt. We are so troubled… farmers are being cheated,” Shankarlal said.During a public hearing on Tuesday, Shankarlal filed an application with the district administration. Dismissing the claims of inaction by officials, the Mandsaur administration clarified that farmer Shankarlal continues to hold possession of the said land.In an official statement, the Collector of Mandsaur Dilip Kumar said, “The applicant Shankar Lal, son of Phoolchand, is himself in possession of 1/2 of his land. The administration received the application sympathetically and heard the matter. Based on the facts, no person/land mafia has occupied the applicant’s land. The applicant Shankar Lal, son of Phoolchand, submitted an application to the district administration during the public hearing. The administration received the application sympathetically and heard the matter. Further action regarding the application was taken at a quick pace. The said application was examined.”जनसुनवाई के दौरान आवेदक श्री शंकर लाल पिता फूलचंद द्वारा आवेदन दिया गया था। इनकी 1/2 भूमि पर स्वयं का कब्जा है। उक्त संबंध में कोई कार्यवाही लंबित नहीं है- कलेक्टर श्री दिलीप कुमार @JansamparkMP pic.twitter.com/SRl8HDtttpAccording to the Tehsildar’s report, which was based on documents provided by the local administration, there are 2.5 hectares of land in Surkheda village, area number 604, and 1.01 hectares in survey number 625. Here, the aggrieved farmer Shankarlal and his family, which includes Anokhilal, Bhagwan Bhai, and Resham Bhai, sons of Phoolchand, as well as Baba Ghasiram, Karu Lal, Ramlal, Prabhu Lal, Mangi Bai, and Parvati Bai, children of Ghati, jointly own this land.Collector Dilip Kumar further stated that half of this land was sold to Ashwin, the son of Narayan Rao, a Mandsaur resident, using a sale deed dated December 31, 2010. The transfer of the aforementioned land was authorised by the then Tehsildar, Sitamau, in the 2010-11 transfer registry. However, Karu Lal, Ramlal, Prabhu Lal, Mangi Bai, and Parvati Bai continue to hold the sold land and its possession has not been taken over by Ashwin.“After examination, the facts regarding the application are that the land situated in village Surkheda, survey number 604 and 625, total area 3.52 hectares, was registered in the hands of joint account holders Shankar Lal, Anokhi Lal, Bhagwan Bai, Reshambai, son of Phoolchand, 1/2 and Sampatbai, widow of Ghasiram, Karulal, Ramlal Prabhu Lal, Mangi Bai, Parvati Bai, son of Ghasi, his share was 1/2. Out of which, co-account holders Sampatbai etc. sold their share of land to Ashwin, son of Narayan Deshmukh in 2010. And the said land was not occupied by the buyer Ashwin,” the Collector’s statement continued.The collector also added that if Shankarlal has any grievance over the sale of the portion of the land by the other owners, he should approach the civil court. No land mafia has occupied the farmer’s land and the applicant Shankarlal still occupies the concerned land, the collector clarified on the matter.“It is worth mentioning here that the applicant Shankar Lal, son of Phoolchand, is currently in possession of 1/2 land which is the applicant’s share and the land which was sold by co-shared person Sampatbai etc. in 2010 is also in possession of Shankar Lal, son of Phoolchand till date.

"13 July, 2024",Congress spokesperson spreads fake news that BSNL made profits during UPA govt and suffering losses under the BJP: Here is the truth,https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/congress-spokesperson-lies-that-bsnl-made-profit-during-upa-and-suffered-loss-during-nda/,"The claim that BSNL was profiting in 2013, the last full financial year when the UPA government was in power is “Fake”. It is pertinent to note that BSNL’s profit steeply started declining after 2005 and FY 2009-10 was the first time when BSNL started incurring losses. Recently, Congress Spokesperson and National Secretary of the Indian Youth Congress, Roshni Kushal Jaiswal shared a short video on the ‘financial health’ of Indian telecom service provider, BSNL. In her post, she gave misleading figures to allege that BSNL has been “ruined” under the BJP-led NDA government. She also falsely claimed that the national telecom service provider had registered profit when the Congress-led UPA was in power. In the video and text, the Congress spokesperson 
However, the numbers she quoted in her post are grossly incorrect. Contrary to the figures quoted by the Congress functionary, BSNL was not even in profit in 2013. Rather it was in a loss of Rs 14979 crores. झूट बोलो, बार-बार झूट बोलो।@roshnikushal का यही काम है।2013 में BSNL 10183 करोड़ के मुनाफ़े में नहीं, बल्कि 14979 करोड़ घाटे में थी।2023 में BSNL 13356 करोड़ के घाटे में नहीं बल्कि 8161 करोड़ के घाटे में थी।सरकार को संज्ञान लेना चाहिए व कांग्रेसियों पर कार्रवाई करनी चाहिए। https://t.co/qzwJaz3Zng pic.twitter.com/4aqYBsudJDSimilarly, BSNL registered a loss of Rs 8,161 crore in FY2023 and not Rs 13,356 crores as the Congress functionary falsely claimed.The claim that BSNL was profiting in 2013, the last full financial year when the UPA government was in power is “Fake”. It is pertinent to note that BSNL’s profit steeply started declining after 2005 and FY 2009-10 was the first time when BSNL started incurring losses. Incidentally, it was the time when the UPA government was in power and the country, especially, the telecom sector was rocked by one scam after another.  Contrary to the allegations that the Modi-led NDA government caused the ill-health of BSNL, the following snippets from media reports are examples of how the allegations of corruption and scams during the UPA era “ruined” the Telecom sector and dented BSNL’s financial health to such an extent that since 2009-10 when it incurred losses for the first time, it has not earned the profitable territory. It adversely impacted the basic infrastructure of the telecom service provider.UPA-era Ministers who were at the helm of affairs in the telecom sector had faced serious allegations of corruption, while the Former Cabinet Ministers have avoided jail terms in these cases on grounds of lack of evidence, hampered BSNL to a great extent. On the contrary, the Modi government has made multiple efforts to revive the ailing telecom service provider including the announcement of three revival packages for BSNL.The first revival package was announced in October 2019. It was worth Rs 69,000 and it helped stabilise BSNL as it brought down excessive employee expenses and in FY21 BSNL losses were nearly halved. After the second revival package announced in 2022 which was worth Rs 1.64 lakh crore, average revenue per user for BSNL/MTNL started seeing improvements. Post revival plans, the telecom service provider has marked a drop in losses. Post the two revival packages, BSNL started witnessing operating profit from FY 2020-21. Last year in June, the Modi government announced a third revival package worth Rs 89,047 crores for the state telecom provider. It included allotment of 4G/5G spectrum for BSNL through equity infusion. Additionally, the union cabinet increased the authorised capital for BSNL from Rs 1.5 lakh crore to Rs 2.1 lakh crore, allowing it to raise more funds from the market for its growth. As per reports, the BSNL officials in January this year revealed that its income has gone up, and expenses have also been cut down in 2023-24.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Despite this, the cameraman kept filming without her consent.On Friday (26th July), BJP spokesperson Shazia Ilmi came down heavily on Rajdeep Sardesai after the latter accused her of ‘attacking’ the cameraman of the India Today group.Ilmi had left the primetime debate of the ‘propagandist masquerading as journalist’ half-way after he asked to cut off the mic of the BJP spokesperson. Despite this, the cameraman kept filming without her consent, leading to a physical altercation.In a tweet, Shazia Ilmi stated, “Don’t you ever bring down my Fader again. Remember I have been on both the sides and know how to handle bullies like you. BTW it doesn’t behove political propagandists masquerading as journalists to sermonise.”Ma’am, @shaziailmi I respect all my guests always.

"23 July, 2024","Innocence exploited – How NewsLaundry lied and defamed Hindu activist Bittu Bajrangi, who spoke to them in good faith",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/newslaundry-lied-defamed-hindu-bittu-bajrangi-spoke-to-them-in-good-faith-nuh-violence/,"While granting bail to Bittu, the court noted, “It has nowhere been pointed out that as to whether these weapons were being used to cause violence on the spot or to inflict any injury either to the policemen or to any people of a particular community. No such allegations are there. Snatching of such articles/weapons from the policemen is also highly improbable.” Bittu Bajrangi was accused under sections 148, 149, 332, 353, 186, 395, 397, 506, 25, 54, and 59 of the IPC in connection with the Nuh violence incident.On Saturday, 20th July, propaganda portal Newslaundry published a video interview with Gaurakshak Bajrang Force chief Bittu Bajrangi. While speaking to Bittu, Newslaundry’s reporter Avdesh Kumar spoke to him politely but the agenda with which he approached the interview was sinister.Violence broke out in Nuh during a jalabhishek yatra in July last year, killing six people. Key accused Bittu Bajrangi is set to lead the same yatra today.Catch the cow vigilante in conversation with @ImAvdheshkumar: https://t.co/Mlmg1HouAB pic.twitter.com/drH6xJ1h93The title of the video interview reads, “The main accused of Nuh riots and out on bail Bittu Bajrangi to organize Jalabhishek Yatra again”. The description of the video, which was in Hindi, read, “Bittu Bajrangi, the main accused in the violence that occurred on July 31 last year, is personally inviting people to participate in this procession. We spoke to Bittu Bajrangi in detail about this matter. It should be noted that the violence in Nuh, Haryana, last year created a climate of concern across the state and the country. This violence occurred during a religious procession when a minor dispute between two communities suddenly escalated. Six people lost their lives, and many were injured in the violence.”The description further read, “Bittu Bajrangi, known as a Gau Rakshak, was prominently implicated in this incident. He also runs an organization called Gau Raksha Bajrang Force. Last year, he was arrested on charges of inciting violence and playing an active role in it. The police and administration considered him one of the main accused. Bittu Bajrangi participated in the religious procession during which the violence started. He is accused of inciting his supporters and encouraging them to engage in violent activities. Immediately after the violence, Bittu Bajrangi was taken into police custody, and multiple charges were filed against him. He is currently out on bail.”OpIndia talked to Bittu Bajrangi to get his views on the title and description. He said, “I am heartbroken. I will be vigilant next time before agreeing to an interview”. From his statement, it is evident that he was unaware of how he was going to be presented in the video.No one is denying that there are several cases filed against Bittu Bajrangi, especially linked to his Gau Raksha work. However, in this case, Newslaundry has presented him as if he was the one solely responsible for the Nuh violence that took place on 31st July 2023. OpIndia accessed court documents, including his bail orders by the Sessions Court. There was no mention that he was the main accused. As the order read, Usha [Kundu], HPS Additional Superintendent of Police, Nuh, was posted on the day of the incident. She noticed Bittu and his accomplices coming towards the temple to join the procession.She pointed out in her complaint that Bittu and his accomplices were carrying swords and Trishul-like weapons which were confiscated by the police. After the police confiscated the swords and Trishul, Bittu and his accomplices got into an altercation with the police and staged a protest by sitting on the road in front of the police vehicle. It was then alleged that they forcefully took the weapons away. Defense counsel appearing for Bittu argued that the alleged weapons were just symbols that were carried for display.  While granting bail to Bittu, the court noted, “It has nowhere been pointed out that as to whether these weapons were being used to cause violence on the spot or to inflict any injury either to the policemen or to any people of a particular community. No such allegations are there. Snatching of such articles/weapons from the policemen is also highly improbable.” Bittu Bajrangi was accused under sections 148, 149, 332, 353, 186, 395, 397, 506, 25, 54, and 59 of the IPC in connection with the Nuh violence incident.It was nowhere mentioned in the FIR that Bittu Bajrangi used the weapons or inflicted any injuries on police personnel or people of a particular community.Notably, a trial in the matter has started in the Sessions court and a non-bailable warrant was issued against Bittu as he failed to appear in court via video conferencing. His counsel argued there was some miscommunication but NBW was issued by the court. However, that still does not prove that he played any role in the violence.Newslaundry’s description lacks facts. They mentioned that six people were killed but did not mention what was the reason behind it. Newslaundry failed to mention that a Hindu boy named Abhishek was shot dead and then beheaded by an Islamist mob. Abhishek’s head was then crushed with a stone. Newslaundry did not make a video explaining how an Islamist mob attacked a cybercrime police station or how a female judge was attacked during the violence by the Islamist mob when she was traveling with her daughter. Shops of Hindus were burnt to the ground, Hindu pilgrims were made hostages in a temple, and police personnel and home guards were killed by the riotous Islamist mob. This is how propaganda works and Newslaundry is an expert in it.As mentioned earlier, no one is denying the cases against Bittu. He mentioned that there are around eight cases currently pending against him and he has been in and out of jail over such cases. But that does not nullify the fact that he has tirelessly worked for the welfare of the Hindu community including Gau Raksha. While propaganda portals do not skip a breath before mentioning terrorists like Afzal Guru as a professor or riot-accused Umar Khalid as a “student activist”, when it comes to Hindu activists like Bittu, they present them as no less than terrorists, while hiding the crimes of the Islamists against which those like Bittu Bajrangi act in defense. Hundreds and thousands of Hindu activists are misrepresented by the left-leaning media which often distorts their intentions and work. Take the example of this interview. The NL reporter kept pressing Bittu to “reveal” his political affiliation. Bittu pointed out that he works independently without any political affiliation or “sar par haath” per se.Kumar kept asking if he was associated with RSS, BJP, or VHP. Bittu clearly said that he is inspired by these organizations and attached to them in one way or another. When the reporter said VHP has “disowned” him, Bittu said, “When a family member does something wrong, the elders of the family say in anger ‘he is not part of our family’. That does not necessarily mean that the person who did wrong has been disowned”. The argument visibly rattled the reporter, and he changed his course of questions.From the use of foul language to alleged derogatory social media posts, Kumar did not leave any stone unturned to agitate Bittu during the interview. Bittu at one point said, “I am a very calm person who does not use foul language. However if someone acts against the Hindu community, I may get angry”. He admitted he gets angry but that does not mean he uses foul language every time he speaks, something which Newslaundry’s reporter wanted to present.What could be the aim of such an interview that too just a couple of days before the scheduled Brijmandal Yatra? The aim was simple. Newslaundry wanted to set a narrative that Bittu Bajrangi was the key accused and reason for Nuh’s violence last year. In case anything happens during the 2024 Yatra, the blame would have again gone to Hindu activists. Unfortunately for Newslaundry and fortunately for Bittu, he was not granted permission to attend Yatra. It was one of his bail conditions that he would not visit Nuh until the trial was over, which could have led to the denial of the permission, this, despite there being no proof of his involvement in any violence during the Nuh Yatra, and there being plenty of evidence of the violence unleashed by the Muslim mob.One can only hope nothing happens during the ongoing Brijmandal Yatra as 5,000 police personnel have been deployed by the Haryana government to avoid any sort of agitation or violence. In a country where Hindus are supposedly a majority, they need protection from the police (in the case of Brijmandal Yatra) and the Army (in the case of Amarnath Yatra) to participate in a pilgrimage which speaks volumes about the reality of the situation.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"18 July, 2024",Media reports highlighting high number of ‘zero dose children’ in India paint an incomplete picture of the country’s immunization efforts: Health Ministry,https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/media-reports-of-india-having-high-number-of-zero-dose-children-depict-incomplete-picture-health-ministry/,"The media reports present a flawed comparison with countries without taking into consideration India’s population and high vaccination coverage, the ministry said in a statementThere have been some media reports stating that, in comparison to other countries, India has a high number of ‘zero dose children’ – children who did not receive any vaccine, according to a recent UNICEF report. These reports depict an incomplete picture of the country’s immunization data, as they do not factor in the population base and immunization coverage of the countries compared, said the Union Health Ministry.The accurate and complete narrative of the immunisation efforts of the government can be gauged through a comprehensive understanding of the relative data and programmatic interventions.In India, for most of the antigens, the coverage is more than 90%, which is on par with other high-income countries, e.g., New Zealand (DTP-1 93%), Germany & Finland (DPT-3 91%), Sweden (MCV-1 93%), Luxembourg (MCV-2 90%), Ireland (PCV-3 83%), United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (RotaC 90%), said the Ministry.Even if the India’s coverage of 83% is compared for Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV), which falls at the lowest bracket, it is much higher than the global figures of 65%.India, with its large population, has the highest number of vaccinated children. The target cohort of India is more than 3 times of the other nine countries compared in the graph. Among the compared countries, India is the only country having DTP-1 (Penta-1) coverage above 90% and dropout children, i.e., those that receive a first but not the third dose of DTP (Penta), are 2%, whereas this gap is much wider in other compared countries. These figures are clearly reflective of focused programmatic interventions in the country within the folds of its wide socio-geographic diversity.The country’s Universal Immunization Programme is the largest public health initiative, targeting a massive cohort of 2.6 crore children and 2.9 crore pregnant women annually through 1.2 crore vaccination sessions. The Full Immunization Coverage for FY 2023-24 stands at 93.23% nationally. With consistent efforts to reach and vaccinate all eligible children against vaccine preventable diseases, the country has been able to achieve a noteworthy reduction in the Under-5 Mortality Rate (U5MR) declining from 45 per 1000 live births in 2014 to 32 per 1000 live births (SRS 2020). In addition, India has widened the basket of vaccines with the introduction of six new vaccines under the UIP to increase breadth of protection since 2014.To reach out to zero dose and under vaccinated children, India has implemented initiatives under Mission Indradhanush and Intensified Mission Indradhanush with the support of the States. This has resulted in the reduction in the number of zero dose children by 34% between 2014-2023. Since 2014, 12 phases of Mission Indradhanush have been conducted across all districts wherein 5.46 crore children and 1.32 crore pregnant women have been vaccinated across all phases.India provides maximum number of WHO recommended vaccines under the UIP in comparison to most of the other countries. The mean coverage for India is 83.4%, which is more than 10 percentage point of the global coverage. With high level of coverage of OPV and IPV, India has successfully maintained 13 years of polio-free status since the last polio case was detected in 2011.With 93% DTP-1 (Penta-1) vaccine 1st dose coverage and 93% Measles and Rubella vaccine 1st dose coverage, the drive in the country is to reduce zero-dose children and achieving Measles and Rubella elimination. In recognition of its tireless efforts to combat Measles and Rubella, India was bestowed with the prestigious Measles and Rubella Champion Award by The Measles and Rubella Partnership (American Red Cross, BMGF, GAVI, US CDC, UNF, UNICEF, and WHO) at the American Red Cross Headquarters in Washington DC, USA on March 6th, 2024, the Ministry said.(This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

"16 July, 2024","Victim blaming, intellectual dishonesty and complete lack of empathy: ‘The Hindu’ follows global Left in downplaying assassination attempt on Donald Trump",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/the-hindu-donald-trump-assassination-attempt-whitewashing-democrats-leftist-media-editorial-problems-explained/,"Though a late entrant in this game of whitewashing, The Hindu made it clear that it will not fall far behind its global counterparts in peddling agenda in the name of news editorial.Three days after an assassination attempt was carried out on Donald Trump during an election rally in Pennsylvania, ‘The Hindu’ newspaper on Tuesday (16th July) blamed the former US President for the tragedy that befell him.In a disturbing editorial titled ‘Dodging bullets: On an assassination bid and U.S. politics’, the Indian daily suggested that the attack on Donald Trump was somehow due to his own political rhetorics.‘The Hindu‘ alleged that the former US President supposedly condoned and sympathised with the use of violence in the political sphere. To substantiate its claims, the leftist newspaper cited the example of the 2021 Capitol Hill siege by Trump supporters. “Ironically, the attack comes after months of Mr. Trump and his supporters periodically indulging in rhetoric that condoned or sympathised with violence or violent intentions in the political sphere,”  it claimed.‘The Hindu’ shrewdly invoked a 3-year-old incident to lay the foundation for its vicious claim that Donald Trump was somehow responsible for the assassination attempt, which took one life and injured three others including the ex-US President.The leftist newspaper also ensured that the incumbent US President Joe Biden is projected in a positive light. As part of this narrative-building exercise, ‘The Hindu’ emphasised Biden’ promptness in condemning the attack that nearly claimed the life of Donald Trump.Thanks to its lack of objective reporting, the Indian daily ignored mentioning how Joe Biden and Democrats had been dog-whistling against Donald Trump for a long. The Hindu chose to highlights the 3-year-old Capitol Hill siege but not the recent provocative tweet by Joe Biden.In June this year, the incumbent US President dubbed Donald Trump as a ‘threat to freedom and democracy.’ Joe Biden even went on to label Trump as antithesis to American values. Even a day before the assassination attempt, the incumbent US President continued his diatribe against Donald Trump. However, none of these remarks constituted as ‘violent or inciteful’ political rhetoric to ‘The Hindu’ Editor. ""Most importantly, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, Trump is a threat to this nation."" – Joe Biden yesterday pic.twitter.com/31lNO7bk3pThe editorial by the Indian newspaper read, “President Joe Biden unequivocally and immediately condemned the attack on Mr. Trump, saying that there was no place in America for this. “We must unite as one nation to condemn it. It’s sick.” Similar sentiments were expressed by other political figures.”Not just Joe Biden, prominent Democrats and their loyalists in the media had time and again used violent language to rebuke Donald Trump and rally Americans against him.Thanks to the ‘left-liberal’ privilege, these provocateurs are not held responsible for their vile rhetorics and complete lack of civility. Instead, all attempts are made to silence those who dare to question them.Every single one of these Democrats should be impeached/jailed for inciting the assassination attempt of Donald Trump.It's time for us to use their own January 6th logic against them… pic.twitter.com/o8yNv4bDkXAs expected, ‘The Hindu’ did its best to shield Democrats from criticism. The Indian daily went on to imply that pointing out the dangerous discourse of Joe Biden and his party members in the run-up to the assassination attempt was somehow “vicious commentary” and false equivalence.“The more complex and troubling question is the extent to which the Trump campaign, in its bid to capitalise on the near martyrdom of its candidate, will adopt the language of hate politics, building on vicious comments that have already been circulating on social media since the attack, many of them blaming Democrats for the violence and deliberately conflating political opposition with personal animus,” the newspaper attempted to give a clean chit to the real provocateurs.Another concerning element of the editorial is also its defeating lack of empathy. The fact that the assassination claimed the life of an innocent spectator, critically injured two others and almost killed Donald Trump has little to no mention.He is only mentioned in the context of elections, polarisation in the political discourse and the possible outcome of the 2024 Presidential race. This becomes evident from the following excerpts of the editorial –In its desperate attempt to villainise Donald Trump, ‘The Hindu’ failed to showcase empathy for the primary subject of its editorial piece who braved the assassination ploy with his indomitable spirit to “fight.”The Left ecosystem, particularly in the US, had left no stone unturned to downplay the assassination attempt on Donald Trump. We have seen everything from labelling the attack as ‘staged’ to suggesting that nothing of any significance had occurred.OpIndia had reported in detail how legacy media houses such as the Associate Press, CNN, ABC News, USA Today, MSNBC and The Washington Post wrote outrageous headlines to pass off gunfire as ‘loud noise.’Though a late entrant in this game of whitewashing, The Hindu made it clear that it will not fall far behind its global counterparts in peddling agenda in the name of news editorial.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

The Wire Report by the Associated Press was picked up by many media houses with similar headlines. On 13th July (local time), an assassination attempt on former United States President Donald Trump shook the world. Though Trump is safe, a bullet pierced his ear leading to blood flowing on his face. Photographs and videos of the incident went viral on social media. The incident took place at Trump’s rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. He was immediately escorted off stage by US Secret Service agents and taken away in a motorcade. While the world leaders condemned the assassination attempt, US media tried to downplay the incident.The Associated Press’s first Wire release read, “Donald Trump whisked off stage in Pennsylvania after loud noises rang through the crowd”. The report by the Associated Press was picked up by many media houses with similar headlines.ABC News report, which was based on Associated Press’s wire, read, “Donald Trump escorted off stage by Secret Service during rally after loud noises ring out in crowd”.USA Today’s headline read, “Trump removed from stage by Secret Service after loud noises startles former president, crowd”.MSNBC report’s headline read, “Trump rushed offstage at Pennsylvania rally by Secret Service after loud popping noises heard”. Now-changed, the Washington Post’s headline read, “Trump escorted away after loud noises at Pa. rally”.Washington Post’s post on X read, “Breaking news: Former president Donald Trump was just rushed offstage after loud noises were reported at rally in Pennsylvania.”While media houses downplayed the assassination attempt, several journalists and X users on social media platforms expressed dismay that Trump was alive. A screenshot was shared by Libs of TikTok on X where The Stranger’s journalist Ashley Nerbovig wrote, “Make America aim again”. Ashley later locked and then deactivated her account.This is a journalist for Seattle based news site @TheStranger pic.twitter.com/pkr3veJLrqLibs Of Tiktok also shared two videos of leftist screaming over the assassin missing the “target”. Tiktok user Cele2t3 screamed her lungs out while crying over the missed assassination. Her TikTok account has either been deleted or deactivated. This unhinged leftist is having a meltdown because the sh**ter missed Trump. These people are deranged. pic.twitter.com/7UGmq2vNw6Another TikTok user Super99x expressed similar behaviour. His account has been turned to “private” on TikTok. Leftist cries actual tears because the sh**ter missed Trump. pic.twitter.com/7hxEXuNbVcThe bullet fired at Donald Trump pierced the upper part of his right ear. Trump was immediately escorted off stage by US Secret Service agents and taken to a hospital. In a statement, the US Secret Service said that a suspected shooter fired multiple shots towards the stage from an elevated position outside of the rally venue during Trump’s campaign rally in Butler on July 13 at 6:15 pm.The attacker has been identified as Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. He was neutralised by security forces after he fired multiple shots from an AR-15-type semiautomatic rifle. One person in the rally died in the incident, and two others were seriously injured. Former President Trump is definitely an eye sour for the left-liberals of the US. There have been countless attempts including shutting his social media accounts to supress his voice. The elections are scheduled in the US in coming months and such attempts are only going to make his support base stronger, something that Trump haters yet to understand.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"24 July, 2024","The destruction of Mecca and Medina: How Wahabi Islam razed down ancient structures like Taliban destroyed Bamiyan Buddhas, fearing idolatry",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/the-destruction-of-mecca-medina-how-wahabi-islam-razed-down-ancient-structures-fearing-idolatry/,"Of the famed ""Seven Mosques"" originally established by Prophet Muhammad's daughter and four of his ""greatest Companions"" five have been demolished namely: Masjid Abu Bakr, Masjid Salman al-Farsi, Masjid Umar ibn al-Khattab, Masjid Sayyida Fatima bint Rasulillah, and Masjid Ali ibn Abi Talib.Saudi Arabia, a Middle Eastern country, is the land of the holiest sites of Islam—Mecca and Medina. The country attracts lakhs of Muslims from across the world for Haj pilgrimage. While it is widely known that Islam despises idol worship, none has been as rabidly against idol worshipping as the Wahabis and the House of Saud. Over mere apprehension that certain Islamic heritage sites in Saudi Arabia would encourage idol-worship, the Saudi government and Wahabis in the past have razed them and modified their usage.Before delving into how historic structures have over the years been destroyed to prevent the promotion of ‘idol worship’, it is pertinent to learn about who the Wahabis are and about the House of Saud.The Wahhabis are the most conservative sect of Sunni Islam. This fundamentalist branch of Islam called Wahabism was founded by Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahab in the 18th century. Wahabis strive to ‘return’ to the “pure” form of Islam as practised and propagated by Prophet Muhammad. Wahhabism emphasizes stringent monotheism and vehemently opposes practices like idol worship as it is shirk [sin], including the veneration of saints/sufis and the use of religious relics etc.Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahab had sought refuge in Diriyah, a small oasis town on the outskirts of modern-day Riyadh. Diriyah was ruled by its Chieftain Muhammad ibn Saud from the Al Saud. Saud not only gave refuge to Wahab after he was thrown out of Hejaz, the region that housed both Mecca and Medina but also signed a pact with him in 1744. This “Wahhabi-Saudi Pact” marked the beginning of the First Saudi state wherein Muhammad ibn Saud became the Emir while Wahab assumed the title of “Imam”.To solidify the accord, Ibn Saud’s eldest son married al-Wahhab’s daughter and Al Saud publicly accepted Wahhabism. Wahab’s puritanical form of Islam passionately opposed religious innovation (bidaa) and pushed for the abolition of traditions such as Sufi ceremonies and saint veneration. During their conquest outside of Najd, they demolished several Shia shrines. The Wahabis employed the insult ‘Rafida’ (rejecters) to classify Shia, a practice that persists into the twenty-first century.The radical ideology of Wahhabism has resulted in the systematic destruction of several Saudi heritage monuments. Wahhabis believed conserving these places would give rise to idol worship, which is forbidden under their understanding of Islam. Thus, many historical and religious structures have been razed to prohibit any form of worship or pilgrimage that contradicts their rigid monotheistic perspectives.In the year 1802, Wahhabi forces led by Saud bin Abdul-Aziz attacked the city of Karbala which came under the Ottoman Empire’s rule. Karbala to this day remains a holy site for Shias. During the Diriyah campaign, Abdul-Aziz-led forces destroyed the tomb of Husayn ibn Ali killed thousands of Shia inhabitants and plundered the city. The Wahabis carried out this massacre of over two to five thousand Shias right ahead of the month of Muharram.Although Karbala is in modern-day Iraq, the Wahabi-Saudi attack on this Shia-revered site gives an insight into the fanatic mindset of the Wahabis. The Wahabis deem rituals such as intercession [shafa’ah] which means pleading to Allah through a Muslim saint, erecting structures over graves, pilgrimages (ziyarah), and tawassul [means that can be used to gain nearness to Allah]to be signs of shirk [polytheism/idolatry] and strongly oppose them.By 1806, the Wahabis captured the city of Medina and unleashed massive destruction of structures they feared would promote idolatry. The Wahabi forces razed all domes and structures within, and outside, of the Jannat-al Baqi cemetery. This was no ordinary cemetery but the first Islamic cemetery in Medina in Hejaz. They also destroyed the Mosque of Fatima al-Zahra, the Mosque of al-Manaratain, and Qubbat’ al-Thanaya among other structures of Islamic significance.After the death of Tusun Pasha, the son of Egypt’s Wali Muhammad Ali Pasha who led Ottoman forces against the Emir of Diriyah, Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Saud in 1816, in 1818, the Ottoman caliphate led by Sultan Mahmoud II decided to crush the Wahabis. In this vein, Tusun Pasha’s son Ibrahim Pasha led his forces to Diriyah, inflicting a crushing defeat on the Wahabis and reclaiming Mecca and Medina. With this, the first Saud state rule came to an end. After this, the Ottomans grandly renovated the mosques. They also constructed a dome on the vandalised Baqi’ cemetery over the graves of the Prophet Muhammad’s daughter Fatima al-Zahra, Zainul ‘Abidin (‘Ali bin al-Hussain), Muhammad ibn ‘Ali al-Baqir and Ja’far al-Sadiq.The architectural grandeur, however, did not last long as in 1924, the House of Saud regained control of the two Islamic holy cities—Mecca and Medina. The Wahabi Sauds undertook a second campaign against the Jannat ul Baqi cemetery and unleashed the destruction of graves, mosques, domes and other structures. With the permission of King Ibn Saud on 25 April 1925, Mausoleums, domes, and gravestones were destroyed by the Wahabi forces. The graves destroyed here included those of Prophet Muhammad’s mother Aminah, father Abdullah ibn Abdul-Muttalib and other family members in addition to prominent Imams.To this day, the Wahabi clerics justify the destruction of many such heritage sites saying that structures dedicated to the mortal beings diluted the worship of a single and unique Allah.Notably, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has undertaken four major expansion projects to accommodate more pilgrims arriving at the Grand Mosque. King Abdulaziz initiated the first such project in 1955 involving the construction of new floors, courtyards, and the installation of electric lights and fans., the second was launched by King Fahd in 1988 for adding new wings on the eastern and western sides, the construction of minarets, and the installation of escalators and air conditioning systems and other facilities.In 2008, the Saudi government, led by King Abdullah Ibn Abdulaziz, approved the Grand Mosque’s expansion, which included the expropriation of 3,200,000 sq ft of land to the north and northwest of it. In 2011, King Abdullah’s government announced that under the “King Abdullah Expansion Project” worth $21 billion several new structures including minarets would be erected and the circumambulation (Mataf) area would be expanded to accommodate 2.5 million Haj pilgrims. Since then, numerous heritage sites have been demolished in the two holy cities.Among the notable structures destroyed included the Ottoman portico, which was a significant architectural feature. This structure dates back to the 17th century and was renowned for its distinctive arches and columns. The destruction of the Ottoman portico sparked strong outrage in Turkey in 2013. Besides, Abbasid-era columns, also integral to the historical architecture of the mosque, were destroyed during the expansion.Reports say that since 1985, 98% of the historical and Islamic heritage sites have been demolished with critics alleging that the Saudi government wants to “wipe out” history. A notable such site included the house of Hamza, the Prophet Muhammad’s uncle. This house was destroyed to make way for a hotel.Similarly, the house of Prophet Muhammad’s wife Khadijah was demolished and 1400 public toilets were built at the site nearly a decade back. This is also confirmed by British historian Ziauddin Sardar in his book Mecca: The Sacred City.“The complex stands on top of the bulldozed al-Ayad fort, built in 1781 and no longer able to perform its function of protecting Mecca from invaders. At the opposite end of the Grand Mosque Complex, as it is now called, the house of Khadijah, the first wife of the Prophet Muhammad, has been turned into a block of toilets.2 The Royal Makkah Clock Tower is not the only building to hover above the Sacred Mosque. There is the Raffles Makkah Palace, a luxury hotel, with round-the-clock butler service. Add to that the Makkah Hilton, built over the house of Abu Bakr, the closest companion of the Prophet and the first caliph. Along with the Intercontinental Mecca, they all vie for prominence on the skyline. There are numerous other five-star hotels and high-rise apartment blocks,” Sardar wrote. He further added, “Within the next decade, there will be a ring of 130 skyscrapers looking down upon the Sacred Mosque. There are spectacular plans to further redevelop the Sacred Mosque so that it can accommodate up to 5 million worshippers. With a seemingly casual disregard for history, the Saudis are rebuilding the Ottoman-era section of the Haram, the oldest surviving section of the Sacred Mosque. The interior, of exquisite beauty, with intricately carved marble columns, built by a succession of Ottoman sultans – Sultan Suleiman, Sultan Salim I, Sultan Murad III, and Sultan Murad IV from 1553 to 1629, will give way to a series of multi-storey prayer halls, eighty metres high.”“The columns, which are adorned with calligraphy of the names of the Prophet’s companions, will be demolished. Indeed, the whole of the old Sacred Mosque will be bulldozed. History stretches back to Umar, the second caliph of Islam, ibn Zubair, who sacrificed his life to rebuild the Kaaba, and to the Abbasid caliphs, who will be replaced by an ultra-modern doughnut-shaped building. The new Jamarat Bridge will ultimately be twelve storeys high, so pilgrims will be able to ‘Stone the Devils’ on even more multiple levels. It seems only a matter of time before the house where Prophet Muhammad was born, located opposite the imposing Royal Palace, is razed to the ground, and turned, probably, into a car park,” Sardar wrote.On the 13th of August 2002, the 1,200-year-old mosque and tomb of Sayyid Imam al-Uraidhi ibn Ja’far al-Sadiq, the ninth in the line of Prophet Muhammad, located four kilometres from Masjid-e Nabawi in Medina, was destroyed by explosives and levelled.In 2003, a historic Ottoman Ajyad Fortress that once protected Mecca from attack and dated back over 200 years was demolished, only to be rebuilt by a massive 601-meter Mecca Royal Hotel Clock Tower. This clocktower is part of a complex built by the Bin Laden Group including five-storey shopping malls, luxury hotels, parking etc.At that time, Turkey had sought UNESCO’s intervention to stop the Fortress’s destruction, however, UNESCO did not intervene.Besides, several mountains have also been destroyed in the holy city to construct roads. In 2013,  the split in Mount Uhud, north of Medina was filled with concrete. Reports say that Prophet Muhammad was carried there after being wounded in the Battle of Uhud against the Quraysh in 625 AD.In addition to this, the famous Hilton Hotel was built over the site where once the house of Abu Bakr, the first caliph, stood.Dr Irfan al-Alawi, historian, founder and former executive director of the Islamic Heritage Research Foundation estimated that over 300 Islamic heritage sites have been demolished over the years as a part of the expansion projects.“Six small mosques in Medina where Muhammad is believed to have prayed have been locked. The seventh, belonging to Islam’s first caliph Abu Bakr, has been razed to make way for an ATM,” a TIME Magazine report from 2014 reads.Of the famed “Seven Mosques” originally established by Prophet Muhammad’s daughter and four of his “greatest Companions” five have been demolished namely: Masjid Abu Bakr, Masjid Salman al-Farsi, Masjid Umar ibn al-Khattab, Masjid Sayyida Fatima bint Rasulillah, and Masjid Ali ibn Abi Talib.Interestingly, over 75 years ago, the birthplace of Prophet Muhammad was reportedly turned into a “cattle market” near Ka’ba. At present, his birthplace located at Suq al-Layl Street has been turned into a library named Makkah Al Mukarramah Library by the Saudi government.There are six UNESCO heritage sites in Saudi Arabia: The Gateway to Mecca and Medina, At-Turaif District in Diriyah, Rock Art of the Hail Region, Al-Hijr Archaeological Site (Madain Salih), Al Ahsa Oasis and Hima Cultural Area. While the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization has been advocating for the preservation of heritage sites across the world, it has failed to advocate for the preservation of sites of cultural and religious significance.Back in March 2001, Afghanistan’s Taliban government demolished the Bamiyan Buddhas, two enormous statues carved into the cliffs of the Bamiyan Valley in the sixth century.

"22 July, 2024",The story of Bhagat Singh Thind: A Sikh immigrant who claimed to be ‘White’ and sought citizenship in the USA,https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/bhagat-singh-thind-a-sikh-immigrant-who-claimed-to-be-white-and-sought-citizenship-in-the-usa/,"In 1923, the Supreme Court ruled against him. The court classified him as Caucasian but not considered him “White” by the common man’s understanding of the term.Bhagat Singh Thind was born in 1892 in Amritsar, Punjab, India. He was raised in a devout Sikh family. Before shifting to the USA in 1913, Thind pursued his education at Khalsa College. When he was 20 years old, he moved to Seattle, Washington. Later, he moved to Oregon and worked at a lumber mill in Astoria. Oregon was famous for being a hub of Indian immigrants and a lot of them were associated with the Ghadar Party, a revolutionary group aiming to kick out Britishers from India. [PDF]#TIL Bhagat Singh Thind, a Sikh immigrant, tried to claim citizenship to the USA arguing that he was Aryan and therefore, of the White Race.😂😂😂😂😂 pic.twitter.com/6iiGPO1RewDuring his time in Oregon, it is believed that he was associated with Ghadar Party activists and supported the cause of kicking out Britishers from India. However, during World War I, while the Ghadar Party made a call to all Indians to join forces against the Britishers, Thind decided to choose a different path. He got himself enlisted in the US Army. He was among the first turbaned Sikhs to serve in the American military. Due to his loyalty to the US, he was granted honorary citizenship, a promise made by the US Government to the immigrant soldiers. However, later his citizenship was revoked. Thind decided to legally fight for citizenship.In 1920, his case reached the US Supreme Court. Thind claimed to be “White” to gain citizenship contending he was a Caucasian belonging to the Aryan race. The crux of the case was whether Thind, who belonged to a high caste in India, could be considered “White” under the naturalization laws of the US. In 1923, the Supreme Court ruled against him. The court classified him as Caucasian but not considered him “White” by the common man’s understanding of the term. The decision led to other Asian immigrants losing their citizenship.In the case of United States vs Bhagat Singh Thind, the Supreme Court faced a complex issue. The court had to decide if a High-caste Hindu of full Indian blood, could be considered a “White person” under the Naturalization Act of 1790 or not. Notably, the court’s ruling in Thind’s case contradicted the earlier decision in Ozawa vs United States where a Japanese man was denied citizenship on racial grounds. The court accepted Thind was Caucasian but refused to classify him as a “White person” based on the common understanding of the time and not on “scientific” classification. The court also noted that the Aryan Theory was anyway dismissed by several scholars if not all.Justice Sutherland, who delivered the judgment, emphasised that the words “free white persons” were meant to include only those whom the original framers of the law knew as white, basically immigrants from the British Isles and Northwestern Europe. The racial diversity of more recent immigrants, including those from Eastern, Southern, and Middle Europe, was acknowledged, but people of primarily Asiatic stock, including Hindus, were not considered part of this group.Thind continued his fight for citizenship and later achieved it in 1936 under the Nye-Lea Act which granted citizenship to WWI veterans. Later, the doors to the US were opened for other immigrants as well.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

"24 July, 2024","Muslims open up about how women go missing in Mecca: Kidnapped, groped, and abused, how crimes against women during Hajj go largely unnoticed",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/muslims-women-go-missing-in-mecca-kidnapped-groped-crimes-against-women-during-hajj/,"Not only men, but women have also been reportedly involved in kidnappings. In 2022, a Pakistani woman was arrested for kidnapping a 5-year-old Burmese national girl in Mecca. She was abducted on 29th October and recovered on 1st November.On 21st July, an X user Shadab (ImShadab_) shared disturbing information on the platform that the wife of a known person was abducted by a cab driver during Hajj. Despite the efforts of the police, the wife could not be traced and the husband had to return alone. Screenshots of the now-deleted posts were shared on X by HPhobiaWatch.Wtf is happening in Mecca & Medina??? pic.twitter.com/Q53UbJ1G1AReplying to Shadab, who has now locked his profile after the post went viral, an X user Sadique said a similar incident happened to a girl who was kidnapped by a cab driver. After keeping her allegedly for several days, he left her at the same hotel where she was staying. Later the girl committed suicide. He alleged that girl was raped.Another X user Bajify said a similar incident happened to his neighbour last year. The newlywed couple went to Madina for a pilgrimage. When the husband got out of the cab, the driver ran away with the bride.Another user Mohammed Junaid Khan wrote, “I remember the driver taking us from Makkah to Madinah was throwing phone numbers at all the women. The whole way he was harassing. A similar incident happened. The husband got down to buy water, the driver fled away taking the wife. She was never found.”Women going missing during Hajj is not an uncommon occurrence. OpIndia found several news reports of women gone missing, kidnapped, raped, groped and so on. On 30th October 2023, a report by 964media alleged that a woman from Kalar in the southern Sulaymaniyah governorate went missing in Saudi Arabia where she was performing Umrah. The 59-year-old woman’s family said she travelled with her brother and several other relatives.Her brother said, “We entered the Grand Mosque at precisely 9:24 AM last Friday, and before starting to circle the Kaaba, we hired someone to help her circle it in her wheelchair. We specified a location for him to return her to us upon completion, but he did not come back. We do not want to assume that he might have abducted her. In addition to alerting the security forces, we searched for her in hospitals and with the forensic medicine department but did not find any leads. That’s why we have shared our contact information and requested assistance in finding her.”In 2018, CNN published a detailed report on stories of five women who faced sexual abuse at the Hajj. The report suggested that the most of sexual abuse and harassment incidents were reported to have happened during the tawaf ritual where the pilgrims do a counter-clockwise procession around the Kaaba shrine. Some of the women who talked to CNN reported the incident to the police but claimed that the police ignored their plea.The first story was of a Pakistani woman named Asra Nadeem living in the US who went on pilgrimage at the age of 21 in 2006. After she got stuck in the 2006 stampede, she went again to Mecca to perform Umrah. During that time, she was alone. While performing tawaf, someone grabbed her bum. Later, someone grabbed her breast. When she turned to look who was there, the man smirked at her while he continued to grab her breast.Another story was of an anonymous British woman who was sexually assaulted in Mecca in 2007. Then-32-year-old woman’s breasts and arms were grabbed while performing tawaf. As the procession continued, she felt someone rubbing his erection on her. When she tried to inform the police, she was shooed away. Moments later, someone pushed his hand between her buttocks. She cried and turned only to see a man smiling at him who said, “Alhamdulillah” (Praise to God).The third story was of a woman from Indonesia who faced harassment in 2011. At that time, she was only 17. When she was at the hotel, she was catcalled. At Kabba, during tawaf, she felt someone pushing erected genitalia against her. She never went back for pilgrimage after that.The fourth story was of an anonymous woman from Egypt who faced harassment when she was only 13 years old. When she was returning to the hotel after Umrah, a shopkeeper catcalled her. The second time, during Hajj, someone grabbed her breast. When she looked back, the man who grabbed her breast was standing there with his wife. At that time, she was only 17.The last story was of Anooshe Mushtaq, a Pakistani woman from Australia. When she was 10 years old, she went for Hajj with her family. A young man groped the little child from behind. On the bus, the conductor groped her upper leg and moved his hand on her chest. As mentioned before, she was only 10 years old at that time.In September 2022, Desert Sun reported that a 42-year-old woman was kidnapped in Mecca. She was choked and held for eight hours. The man who kidnapped her was arrested and identified as 39-year-old Daniel Gamez Zaragoza.Not only men, but women have also been reportedly involved in kidnappings. In 2022, a Pakistani woman was arrested for kidnapping a 5-year-old Burmese national girl in Mecca. She was abducted on 29th October and recovered on 1st November.In 2010, it was reported that an Indian-origin girl identified as Mariam was kidnapped from Mecca. This was the first time she was visiting Mecca. Her father said, “We have been here every year for Umrah. She is in the custody of some evil people who are not allowing her to contact us.” The family has been living in Saudi Arabia for 17 years. She went missing after her mother gave her one-riyal bills to distribute among beggers after the pilgrimage. At that time, Mariam was in class 9.These reports are just tip of the iceberg. There are dozens of horrifying incidents crimes against women during Hajj.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"24 July, 2024","The destruction of Mecca and Medina: How Wahabi Islam razed down ancient structures like Taliban destroyed Bamiyan Buddhas, fearing idolatry",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/the-destruction-of-mecca-medina-how-wahabi-islam-razed-down-ancient-structures-fearing-idolatry/,"Of the famed ""Seven Mosques"" originally established by Prophet Muhammad's daughter and four of his ""greatest Companions"" five have been demolished namely: Masjid Abu Bakr, Masjid Salman al-Farsi, Masjid Umar ibn al-Khattab, Masjid Sayyida Fatima bint Rasulillah, and Masjid Ali ibn Abi Talib.Saudi Arabia, a Middle Eastern country, is the land of the holiest sites of Islam—Mecca and Medina. The country attracts lakhs of Muslims from across the world for Haj pilgrimage. While it is widely known that Islam despises idol worship, none has been as rabidly against idol worshipping as the Wahabis and the House of Saud. Over mere apprehension that certain Islamic heritage sites in Saudi Arabia would encourage idol-worship, the Saudi government and Wahabis in the past have razed them and modified their usage.Before delving into how historic structures have over the years been destroyed to prevent the promotion of ‘idol worship’, it is pertinent to learn about who the Wahabis are and about the House of Saud.The Wahhabis are the most conservative sect of Sunni Islam. This fundamentalist branch of Islam called Wahabism was founded by Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahab in the 18th century. Wahabis strive to ‘return’ to the “pure” form of Islam as practised and propagated by Prophet Muhammad. Wahhabism emphasizes stringent monotheism and vehemently opposes practices like idol worship as it is shirk [sin], including the veneration of saints/sufis and the use of religious relics etc.Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahab had sought refuge in Diriyah, a small oasis town on the outskirts of modern-day Riyadh. Diriyah was ruled by its Chieftain Muhammad ibn Saud from the Al Saud. Saud not only gave refuge to Wahab after he was thrown out of Hejaz, the region that housed both Mecca and Medina but also signed a pact with him in 1744. This “Wahhabi-Saudi Pact” marked the beginning of the First Saudi state wherein Muhammad ibn Saud became the Emir while Wahab assumed the title of “Imam”.To solidify the accord, Ibn Saud’s eldest son married al-Wahhab’s daughter and Al Saud publicly accepted Wahhabism. Wahab’s puritanical form of Islam passionately opposed religious innovation (bidaa) and pushed for the abolition of traditions such as Sufi ceremonies and saint veneration. During their conquest outside of Najd, they demolished several Shia shrines. The Wahabis employed the insult ‘Rafida’ (rejecters) to classify Shia, a practice that persists into the twenty-first century.The radical ideology of Wahhabism has resulted in the systematic destruction of several Saudi heritage monuments. Wahhabis believed conserving these places would give rise to idol worship, which is forbidden under their understanding of Islam. Thus, many historical and religious structures have been razed to prohibit any form of worship or pilgrimage that contradicts their rigid monotheistic perspectives.In the year 1802, Wahhabi forces led by Saud bin Abdul-Aziz attacked the city of Karbala which came under the Ottoman Empire’s rule. Karbala to this day remains a holy site for Shias. During the Diriyah campaign, Abdul-Aziz-led forces destroyed the tomb of Husayn ibn Ali killed thousands of Shia inhabitants and plundered the city. The Wahabis carried out this massacre of over two to five thousand Shias right ahead of the month of Muharram.Although Karbala is in modern-day Iraq, the Wahabi-Saudi attack on this Shia-revered site gives an insight into the fanatic mindset of the Wahabis. The Wahabis deem rituals such as intercession [shafa’ah] which means pleading to Allah through a Muslim saint, erecting structures over graves, pilgrimages (ziyarah), and tawassul [means that can be used to gain nearness to Allah]to be signs of shirk [polytheism/idolatry] and strongly oppose them.By 1806, the Wahabis captured the city of Medina and unleashed massive destruction of structures they feared would promote idolatry. The Wahabi forces razed all domes and structures within, and outside, of the Jannat-al Baqi cemetery. This was no ordinary cemetery but the first Islamic cemetery in Medina in Hejaz. They also destroyed the Mosque of Fatima al-Zahra, the Mosque of al-Manaratain, and Qubbat’ al-Thanaya among other structures of Islamic significance.After the death of Tusun Pasha, the son of Egypt’s Wali Muhammad Ali Pasha who led Ottoman forces against the Emir of Diriyah, Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Saud in 1816, in 1818, the Ottoman caliphate led by Sultan Mahmoud II decided to crush the Wahabis. In this vein, Tusun Pasha’s son Ibrahim Pasha led his forces to Diriyah, inflicting a crushing defeat on the Wahabis and reclaiming Mecca and Medina. With this, the first Saud state rule came to an end. After this, the Ottomans grandly renovated the mosques. They also constructed a dome on the vandalised Baqi’ cemetery over the graves of the Prophet Muhammad’s daughter Fatima al-Zahra, Zainul ‘Abidin (‘Ali bin al-Hussain), Muhammad ibn ‘Ali al-Baqir and Ja’far al-Sadiq.The architectural grandeur, however, did not last long as in 1924, the House of Saud regained control of the two Islamic holy cities—Mecca and Medina. The Wahabi Sauds undertook a second campaign against the Jannat ul Baqi cemetery and unleashed the destruction of graves, mosques, domes and other structures. With the permission of King Ibn Saud on 25 April 1925, Mausoleums, domes, and gravestones were destroyed by the Wahabi forces. The graves destroyed here included those of Prophet Muhammad’s mother Aminah, father Abdullah ibn Abdul-Muttalib and other family members in addition to prominent Imams.To this day, the Wahabi clerics justify the destruction of many such heritage sites saying that structures dedicated to the mortal beings diluted the worship of a single and unique Allah.Notably, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has undertaken four major expansion projects to accommodate more pilgrims arriving at the Grand Mosque. King Abdulaziz initiated the first such project in 1955 involving the construction of new floors, courtyards, and the installation of electric lights and fans., the second was launched by King Fahd in 1988 for adding new wings on the eastern and western sides, the construction of minarets, and the installation of escalators and air conditioning systems and other facilities.In 2008, the Saudi government, led by King Abdullah Ibn Abdulaziz, approved the Grand Mosque’s expansion, which included the expropriation of 3,200,000 sq ft of land to the north and northwest of it. In 2011, King Abdullah’s government announced that under the “King Abdullah Expansion Project” worth $21 billion several new structures including minarets would be erected and the circumambulation (Mataf) area would be expanded to accommodate 2.5 million Haj pilgrims. Since then, numerous heritage sites have been demolished in the two holy cities.Among the notable structures destroyed included the Ottoman portico, which was a significant architectural feature. This structure dates back to the 17th century and was renowned for its distinctive arches and columns. The destruction of the Ottoman portico sparked strong outrage in Turkey in 2013. Besides, Abbasid-era columns, also integral to the historical architecture of the mosque, were destroyed during the expansion.Reports say that since 1985, 98% of the historical and Islamic heritage sites have been demolished with critics alleging that the Saudi government wants to “wipe out” history. A notable such site included the house of Hamza, the Prophet Muhammad’s uncle. This house was destroyed to make way for a hotel.Similarly, the house of Prophet Muhammad’s wife Khadijah was demolished and 1400 public toilets were built at the site nearly a decade back. This is also confirmed by British historian Ziauddin Sardar in his book Mecca: The Sacred City.“The complex stands on top of the bulldozed al-Ayad fort, built in 1781 and no longer able to perform its function of protecting Mecca from invaders. At the opposite end of the Grand Mosque Complex, as it is now called, the house of Khadijah, the first wife of the Prophet Muhammad, has been turned into a block of toilets.2 The Royal Makkah Clock Tower is not the only building to hover above the Sacred Mosque. There is the Raffles Makkah Palace, a luxury hotel, with round-the-clock butler service. Add to that the Makkah Hilton, built over the house of Abu Bakr, the closest companion of the Prophet and the first caliph. Along with the Intercontinental Mecca, they all vie for prominence on the skyline. There are numerous other five-star hotels and high-rise apartment blocks,” Sardar wrote. He further added, “Within the next decade, there will be a ring of 130 skyscrapers looking down upon the Sacred Mosque. There are spectacular plans to further redevelop the Sacred Mosque so that it can accommodate up to 5 million worshippers. With a seemingly casual disregard for history, the Saudis are rebuilding the Ottoman-era section of the Haram, the oldest surviving section of the Sacred Mosque. The interior, of exquisite beauty, with intricately carved marble columns, built by a succession of Ottoman sultans – Sultan Suleiman, Sultan Salim I, Sultan Murad III, and Sultan Murad IV from 1553 to 1629, will give way to a series of multi-storey prayer halls, eighty metres high.”“The columns, which are adorned with calligraphy of the names of the Prophet’s companions, will be demolished. Indeed, the whole of the old Sacred Mosque will be bulldozed. History stretches back to Umar, the second caliph of Islam, ibn Zubair, who sacrificed his life to rebuild the Kaaba, and to the Abbasid caliphs, who will be replaced by an ultra-modern doughnut-shaped building. The new Jamarat Bridge will ultimately be twelve storeys high, so pilgrims will be able to ‘Stone the Devils’ on even more multiple levels. It seems only a matter of time before the house where Prophet Muhammad was born, located opposite the imposing Royal Palace, is razed to the ground, and turned, probably, into a car park,” Sardar wrote.On the 13th of August 2002, the 1,200-year-old mosque and tomb of Sayyid Imam al-Uraidhi ibn Ja’far al-Sadiq, the ninth in the line of Prophet Muhammad, located four kilometres from Masjid-e Nabawi in Medina, was destroyed by explosives and levelled.In 2003, a historic Ottoman Ajyad Fortress that once protected Mecca from attack and dated back over 200 years was demolished, only to be rebuilt by a massive 601-meter Mecca Royal Hotel Clock Tower. This clocktower is part of a complex built by the Bin Laden Group including five-storey shopping malls, luxury hotels, parking etc.At that time, Turkey had sought UNESCO’s intervention to stop the Fortress’s destruction, however, UNESCO did not intervene.Besides, several mountains have also been destroyed in the holy city to construct roads. In 2013,  the split in Mount Uhud, north of Medina was filled with concrete. Reports say that Prophet Muhammad was carried there after being wounded in the Battle of Uhud against the Quraysh in 625 AD.In addition to this, the famous Hilton Hotel was built over the site where once the house of Abu Bakr, the first caliph, stood.Dr Irfan al-Alawi, historian, founder and former executive director of the Islamic Heritage Research Foundation estimated that over 300 Islamic heritage sites have been demolished over the years as a part of the expansion projects.“Six small mosques in Medina where Muhammad is believed to have prayed have been locked. The seventh, belonging to Islam’s first caliph Abu Bakr, has been razed to make way for an ATM,” a TIME Magazine report from 2014 reads.Of the famed “Seven Mosques” originally established by Prophet Muhammad’s daughter and four of his “greatest Companions” five have been demolished namely: Masjid Abu Bakr, Masjid Salman al-Farsi, Masjid Umar ibn al-Khattab, Masjid Sayyida Fatima bint Rasulillah, and Masjid Ali ibn Abi Talib.Interestingly, over 75 years ago, the birthplace of Prophet Muhammad was reportedly turned into a “cattle market” near Ka’ba. At present, his birthplace located at Suq al-Layl Street has been turned into a library named Makkah Al Mukarramah Library by the Saudi government.There are six UNESCO heritage sites in Saudi Arabia: The Gateway to Mecca and Medina, At-Turaif District in Diriyah, Rock Art of the Hail Region, Al-Hijr Archaeological Site (Madain Salih), Al Ahsa Oasis and Hima Cultural Area. While the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization has been advocating for the preservation of heritage sites across the world, it has failed to advocate for the preservation of sites of cultural and religious significance.Back in March 2001, Afghanistan’s Taliban government demolished the Bamiyan Buddhas, two enormous statues carved into the cliffs of the Bamiyan Valley in the sixth century. Mullah Mohammed Omar, the Taliban leader, ordered the destruction, declaring the monuments blasphemous and against Islamic principles since idols and statues are considered haram by the Taliban as well who are Sunni Muslims of the Deobandi (Hanafi) sect. Ignoring international outrage and condemnation, the Taliban destroyed the ancient statues, which were regarded as Buddhist treasures and part of Afghanistan’s cultural heritage.The destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas by the Taliban is closely aligned with Wahabi (Salafi) extremist ideology, which advocates a strict and puritanical form of Islam.

"19 July, 2024","Remember cries of ‘mob lynching by Gau Rakshaks’ in Chhattisgarh? SIT says Saddam, Chand Miya and Guddu jumped to their death, no evidence of...",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/no-lynching-gau-rakshak-saddam-chand-miya-guddu-jumped-death-chhattisgarh-police-sit-chargesheet/,"Initially, the incident was labelled a mob lynching. Afterwards, an SIT was formed to look into the matter and it filed a charge sheet in the court after concluding the investigation. Notably, the police personnel and the charge sheet disclosed that the Muslim men were never attacked. They leapt into the river out of fear and met their deaths.According to the chargesheet presented to the court last week, a Special Investigation Team stated that the three men who were discovered under a bridge in Arang, in the Raipur region of Chhattisgarh last month, “jumped” to their deaths and were neither lynched nor beaten. The deceased were identified as Saddam Qureshi (23) and his cousin Chand Miya Khan (23) who were from Saharanpur district and Guddu Khan (35) of Shamli district. The postmortem report revealed that their death was caused by their fall onto the rocks.The chargesheet was submitted on 8th July but remained confidential until 17th July, when its single page appeared on social media. A previous First Information Report from the police included charges of assault and attempted murder. A Special Investigation Team (SIT) charged five men Harsh Mishra, Mayank Sharma, Raja Agarwal, Navin Thakur and Tanay Luniya under the counts of culpable homicide and common intention for the killings.On 7th June, the three males were reportedly being pursued by the gau-rakshaks (cow-protectors) on suspicion of smuggling cows when they were taking cattle from Chhattisgarh’s Mahasamund to the state capital Raipur. They were subsequently discovered lying on the rocks beneath a bridge. Chand Miya Khan lost his life immediately while Guddu Khan passed away on the way to the hospital that day and Saddam Qureshi died on 18th June from his wounds. Initially, the incident was labelled a mob lynching. Afterwards, an SIT was formed to look into the matter and it filed a charge sheet in the court after concluding the investigation. Notably, the police personnel and the charge sheet disclosed that the Muslim men were never attacked. They leapt into the river out of fear and met their deaths.The gau rakshaks were waiting for the trio in a car as they had information about cattle smuggling, according to the SIT charge sheet. The gau rakshaks tried to halt the four-wheeler and carry out an inspection but the latter drove away to escape for at least 54 kilometres as a long chase ensued. The Muslim men then got off their truck on the Mahanadi bridge located in Arang and plunged into the river believing that there would be water but it was dry and they ended up losing their lives. According to sources, the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) could not establish assault.The authorities earlier lodged a case under Indian Penal Code sections 304 (culpable homicide) and 307 (attempt to murder). Nevertheless, the police removed the attempted murder charge after Saddam Qureshi died because his autopsy report had no mention of assault-related injuries. “The assault never took place. The three got scared and jumped,” confirmed Additional Superintendent (Raipur Rural) Kirtan Rathore when questioned about the chargesheet on 17th July.The Islamists and its ecosystem, whose primary goal is to provide a communal element where none previously existed and blame Hindus didn’t take much time to resort to their devious tricks in this case either. The members of the Muslim community flocked to the streets in Chhattisgarh to demonstrate against the ‘mob lynching’ as their religious and ideological brethren amplified the same lie online. Social media commentator Harun Khan tweeted a video of a protest in Raipur against the alleged murders of the three Muslim men.Chhattisgarh: Large protest in Raipur against mob lynching, People from Muslim community took to the streets. pic.twitter.com/fbsNtlDYWwAnother Muslim handle referred to the arrest of Harsh Mishra as the first one in the ‘mob lynching’ case and claimed that the latter was hiding at his girlfriend’s residence.

He further threatened, “If justice is not served, we will organize massive protests against the BJP government. We demand accountability and swift action.”The horrific lynching of three Muslim men in Chhattisgarh on June 7th is a clear failure of the BJP government and the state police.

"18 July, 2024","Ravindra Pal alias Dara Singh has been in jail for 24 years without parole, Odisha govt kept the file pending despite multiple recommendations for...",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/dara-singh-alias-ravindra-pal-has-been-in-odisha-jail-for-24-years-without-parole/,"Arvind Kumar Pal has said that Dara Singh alias Ravindra Kumar Pal is now more than 60 years old, and in this situation, he should be allowed to spend the rest of his life among his family members in his ancestral residenceOn 9th July, the brother of Ravindra Kumar Pal, also known as Dara Singh, submitted a plea in the Supreme Court appealing for the latter’s release who is currently serving sentences ranging from one to life imprisonment in four different cases. Advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain will represent Arvind Kumar Pal in the court. On 14 July, the OpIndia team went to the house of Dara Singh, who has been behind bars in Odisha for the last 24 years and met his family to inquire about the matter. Dara Singh is originally from the Uttar Pradesh district of Auraiya. We took a train from Delhi to Phaphund, which is the closest station to his hometown and took a private vehicle to Bazar Kakod on the way to Auraiya City, which is about 10 kilometres away.When we stopped to ask a rider for directions along the route, he asked us straight away in a frustrated tone, “Is he the same Dara Singh who killed the priest who converted Hindus to Christianity? He has suffered grave injustice.” Anyway, he showed us the way and we arrived at the residence of Dara Singh’s brother Arvind Kumar, located in the town of Kakod. He has preserved most of the documents of the legal battle he fought for Dara Singh for 24 years.We finally made it to Dara Singh’s home and met his brother Arvind Kumar Pal. He informed us that letters regarding Dara Singh’s release have been sent from the jail to the Superintendent of Police and District Magistrate of Auraiya from time to time. The DM and SP advocated for his release in response to the letters. However, the Odisha government at the time disregarded the requests. Arvind Pal provided us with evidence in the form of a letter dated 28th February 2018, which was sealed and signed by the District Magistrate of Auraiya and was sent as a reply to a report sought from Keonjhar Jail, Odisha on 18th November 2017. “It is recommended to release Ravindra Kumar Pal alias Dara Singh on premature release,” the officer wrote in letter number 821, citing the district superintendent of police’s report.OpIndia also has the letter issued by the Superintendent of Police Auraiya on 18th January 2018 in which he considered Dara Singh as eligible for release. Afterwards, on 22nd September 2022, once again SP Auraiya filed his remarks on the report sought by Keonjhar Jail of Odisha and suggested the early release of Dara Singh. Speaking to OpIndia, Arvind Kumar Pal claimed that the previous Odisha government ignored multiple pleas for Dara Singh’s release from the Uttar Pradesh government. He blamed the Biju Janata Dal administration, which was headed by Naveen Patnaik, the Odisha chief minister at the time.Dara Singh’s younger brother further told us that after the Odisha government repeatedly ignored the report of the administrative officials of Uttar Pradesh, he appealed to the Prime Minister’s Office and sent a letter on 19th May 2021 demanding the release of Dara Singh. Arvind Kumar Pal contended that his older brother, Ravindra Kumar Pal, also known as Dara Singh, had never been granted parole in the previous 21 years, in the letter. In addition, he brought several other issues to the government’s notice. He noted that the Odisha government’s only answer was to postpone the issue when the Prime Minister’s Office asked for a response to this letter.Arvind Kumar Pal showed us a letter dated 14th July 2021, which was issued by the Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Jail of Odisha. He notified the Odisha Home Secretary in this letter that on 9th July of the same year, the Superintendent of Keonjhar Jail turned in a report which covered the whole matter. The DIG Jail had put the ball in the court of the state government.OpIndia investigated the report filed by the Superintendent of Keonjhar Jail, Odisha on 9th July 2021. The Jail Superintendent has admitted that till July 2021, Dara Singh has served more than 25 years and 3 months of his sentence including remission. The Jail Superintendent authorized higher authorities for further action. However, Arvind Kumar Pal charged that no decision has been taken by the Odisha government on this report so far and the file has been put on hold.Dara Singh is from the Auraiya district’s Dibiyapur police station region. The district government obtained Dara Singh’s information via the local police station following the request for a report to be made in order to secure his release from Odisha jail. Sub Inspector Sher Singh of the Dibiyapur police station handed in his investigation report on 15th September 2022 which pointed out that Dara Singh does not have a criminal record on file with the police station. The local police station officer also called for Dara Singh’s early release in his probe report.The Superintendent of Keonjhar District Jail of Odisha issued a character certificate to Ravindra Kumar Pal alias Dara Singh on 10th June 2022 in which he noted that the latter has been serving jail term in Keonjhar Jail for the last 15 years. Out of this, 3 years of the sentence has been served in the presence of the then Jail Superintendent who issued the certificate and described Dara Singh as a person with good and satisfactory behaviour towards jail personnel and other inmates.Arvind Kumar Pal also sent a letter to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on 11th March 2023 and requested for help, informing that Dara Singh had not received parole for 23 years. He has also given information about the recommendation of Dara Singh’s release several times by the administrative officials of Uttar Pradesh. Arvind Kumar Pal has said that Dara Singh alias Ravindra Kumar Pal is now more than 60 years old, in the letter and in this situation, he should be allowed to spend the rest of his life among his family members in his ancestral residence.Arvind Kumar Pal told us that from the police station in charge of Uttar Pradesh to the SP and DM, all were constantly recommending the release of his brother. His behaviour was also mentioned as good in the jail certificate. In the report of the Odisha administration, his sentence has been counted as more than 25 years (including exemption). The state government of Odisha kept circulating the letter to the Prime Minister’s Office. In such a situation, he sees the Supreme Court as his last hope.The Odisha state government, the jail DG, and the jail superintendent Keonjhar have been named as opponents in Arvind Kumar Pal’s petition. The petition’s next hearing is scheduled for 27th August of this year. The family of Dara Singh is hoping for justice. Arvind Kumar asserted that the Odisha state government would have to inform the Supreme Court of the length of a life sentence and the fact that numerous Naxalites and other infamous offenders have been freed from prison after serving 15 years in the state.Read the report in Hindi here.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

This claim is Misleading. The clock only showed that her speaking time was over. Even the bell was not rung to mark it,” the Press Information Bureau (PIB) said in a post on X.It is being claimed that the microphone of CM, West Bengal was switched off during the 9th Governing Council Meeting of NITI Aayog#PIBFactCheck ▶️ This claim is #Misleading ▶️ The clock only showed that her speaking time was over. Even the bell was not rung to mark it pic.twitter.com/P4N3oSOhBkMeanwhile, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told ANI that it is “completely false” of Mamata Banerjee to claim that her microphone was switched off and claimed that every chief minister at the meeting was “allotted their due time to speak.”“CM Mamata Banerjee attended the Niti Aayog meeting. We all heard her. Every CM was given the allotted time and that was displayed on the screen which was present before every table…She said in the media that her mic was put off. That is completely false, ” Sitharaman told ANI.“Every CM was given their due time to speak…It’s unfortunate that the chief minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee has claimed that her mic was switched off which is not true…She should speak the truth behind this rather than again build a narrative based on falsehood,” the Union Finance Minister said.According to the government fact check body PIB, Mamata Banerjee’s turn to speak would be only after lunch if one goes alphabetically but she was “accomodated” as the seventh speaker on an official request from the Chief Minister.“Alphabetically, CM, West Bengal turn would have come after lunch. She was accommodated as the 7th speaker on an official request of the West Bengal government as she had to return early,” PIB Fact Check explained in a subsequent tweet.Earlier today speaking to reporters, the West Bengal Chief Minister alleged “political discrimination” and said that at the NITI Aayog meeting she was not allowed to speak for more than five minutes while other chief ministers were given more time.“…I said you (central government) should not discriminate against state governments. I wanted to speak but my mic was muted. I was allowed to speak only for five minutes. People before me spoke for 10-20 minutes,” Banerjee told reporters after she stormed out of the NITI Aayog meeting today.“I was the only one from the opposition who was participating but still, I was not allowed to speak. This is insulting…,” Banerjee said as she walked out mid way from the meeting.“I have come out boycotting the NITI Aayog meeting. Chandrababu Naidu was given 20 minutes to speak, Chief Ministers of Assam, Goa, Chhattisgarh spoke for 10-12 minutes. I was stopped after just 5 minutes. This is unfair,” the Chief Minister said speaking to reporters after coming out of the meeting.Claiming that she had chosen to participate in the meeting to strengthen “cooperative federalism” Banerjee said, “There are many regional aspirations. That is why I am here, to share those aspirations. If a state is strong, the Union will be strong.”The Chief Minister said that several states, including West Bengal, were deprived in the Union Budget that was presented in Parliament this week,Asking the central government to treat states equally, Banerjee said, “Bengal has been deprived of MNREGA funds for the last three years, nothing was paid. Treat all states equally. I said that today. I am speaking on behalf of all the states which have been deprived.”Hitting out at the central government over the Budget, the Chief Minister said that the Centre does not support “cooperative federalism.”“From the Opposition side, I am here to strengthen cooperative federalism. But you are not for cooperative federalism. The Budget is totally politically biased. Why discriminate against other states?” Banerjee said.The Trinamool Congress supremo also asked the Centre to give financial powers to NITI Aayog or bring back the Planning Commission.“NITI Aayog has no financial powers, how will it work? Give it financial powers, or bring back the Planning Commission,” she said.Chief Ministers of opposition-led states including Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Telangana, Delhi and Punjab boycotted the NITI Aayog meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.On Wednesday, Chief Minister of Punjab Bhagwant Mann and Telangana Chief Minister Revanth Reddy said that their government will boycott the NITI Aayog in protest against the central government’s alleged injustice to the state in the allocation of funds in the 2024 Union Budget.(This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

"27 July, 2024","As Bhim Army Chief Chandrashekhar Azad ‘Ravan’ pushes for private sector reservations, a look at the economic and social pitfalls of such a step",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/bhim-army-chief-chandrashekhar-azad-private-sector-reservations/,"The bill proposes that the Central government must incentivise private sector entities to implement reservations for SCs, STs, and OBCs by giving them special concessions and facilitating lower-interest loans through nationalised banks.On Friday (26th July), Azad Samaj Party MP from Uttar Pradesh’s Nagina and Bhim Army Chief, Chandra Shekhar Azad introduced a private member bill in Lok Sabha to extend reservations for the SCs, STs, and OBCs in the private sector. The bill is titled, ‘The Reservation for the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes and the Other Backward Classes in Private Sector Act, 2024’. आज मैने लोक सभा में 3 निम्नलिखित गैर सरकारी विधेयक पेश किए-1. निजी क्षेत्रों में अनुसूचित जातियों,अनुसूचित जनजातियों और अन्य पिछड़े वर्गों के लिये आरक्षण की व्यवस्था।2. अनुसूचित जातियों तथा अनुसूचित जनजातियों के बच्चों के लिये आवासीय स्कूल।3. देश मे सभी बालकों को उच्च एवम्… pic.twitter.com/25YDIPZ9ZwCurrently, reservations are only applicable in the public sector and there is no reservation in the private sector. The bill proposes to change this and extend reservation benefits to the SC, ST, and OBC communities in the private sector as well. The bill introduced by Bhim Army Chief Ravan seeks to extend reservations in the private sector, educational institutions, and other establishments that have no government financial interest and employ at least 20 people. The bill proposes that the Central government must incentivise private sector entities to implement reservations for SCs, STs, and OBCs by giving them special concessions and facilitating lower-interest loans through nationalised banks.It also proposes that the government should present an annual report in both houses of Parliament to highlight all actions that have been taken under the Act, in case it is passed by both houses as well as get Presidential assent. The proposed legislation also wants to make it mandatory for the Union government to frame rules to ensure the effective implementation of the Act (if passed). The bill claims to rely on support from Articles 16(4) and 16(4A) of the Constitution. Incidentally, the said article permits reservations in public sector undertakings (PSUs) and financial institutions receiving government grants.In his statement of objects and reasons, the Bhim Army Chief claimed that to ensure equitable growth and socio-economic upliftment, it is imperative to have representation from all sections of the society while highlighting the importance of the private sector in nation-building. Any Member of Parliament (MP) can also introduce proposed legislation in both houses of Parliament and it is known as the Private Members’ Bill. Just like any other bill proposed by the government, a Private Member bill, to become an act, must be passed by both houses and receive Presidential assent. Notably, such bills can only be introduced and discussed on Fridays. Yesterday (on 26th July), as many as 31 private members’ Bills were introduced in the Lok Sabha. Congress MP Shashi Tharoor also moved a private member bill seeking to reserve 10 seats in the Lok Sabha for those below 35 years of age.Today, I introduced three Private member’s bills in the Lok Sabha. One of them would reserve 10 seats in Parliament for people under the age of 35. We already hold the world record for the biggest gap between the average age of the population and the average age of Parliament. It… pic.twitter.com/T43PFDxkHTNonetheless, it is pertinent to note that while Bhim Army Chief Chandrashekhar Azad has proposed to extend reservations for SCs, STs, and OBCs in the private sector, the Congress government in Karnataka recently proposed to extend reservations in the private sector for Kannadigas. Strikingly, the Cabinet led by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah had decided to present seven bills, including 100% reservation for Kannadigas in Category C and D jobs in all private industries in the state. However, the legislation extending reservations in the private sector for Kannadigas triggered massive opposition from top Industry leaders and within the state government, forcing the state government to halt the proposed legislation for want of ‘further discussions’.Extending reservations, either for locals or the backward communities, in the private sector could have long-term and far-reaching consequences for the economy as well as the social fabric of the country. The proposed legislation would have a chilling effect on meritocracy, ease of doing business, and investment opportunities, as well as could lead to social unrest.As a well-established fact, India, or any other country plagued by Licence or quota raj, witnessed sluggish growth for several decades but it has grown leaps and bounds after the economic reforms in 1991 which liberalised the economy and unshackled private sector from needless legislative compliance. At a time when companies are opting out of China and relocating to countries that have skilled labour, stifling meritocracy for vote bank politics, and pushing reservations in the private sector would be catastrophic. This would not only be dragging India back in this highly competitive race of ‘free’ and open market access for new companies, it would be undoing the progress in economic and other key parameters of Human development post the liberalisation era. The strength of the private sector lies in the easy and flexible accessibility of factors of production, including skilled human resources. Barring the CSR aspect, the private sector links its outcomes with high standards of performance audits. However, with reservations in the private sector and elections always around the corner, companies would face mounting pressure from the ruling party in their state of operation to not fire employees despite audit reviews, as well as to improve recruitment from the communities forming political vote bank, thus putting a constraint on their say on Human resources.This has the potential to limit the functionality of companies causing them to find an exit route to ensure their profit margin and escape the wrath of the government’s and administration’s restrictive measures like the job quota compliance. The government/police intervention in the day-to-day functioning of the company’s operation to ensure compliance would render the companies prone to “corruption”, and “bureaucratic red-tapism”, and send the state/country back to the “License quota raj” period, pre-reform era.Furthermore, rather than striving to build an egalitarian society and uplift marginalised society, the bill’s introduction could lead to social unrest, like the protests during the Mandal era when reservations were made applicable only in the public sector which makes up roughly around 2% of the total workforce. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

The video of the shocking incident went viral on social media in which the latter can be heard asking the senior Congress leader to conclude as he exceeded the allotted time.Sharma requested, “Sixty-five people are scheduled to speak today. You have already spoken for 30 minutes,” to which he replied, “That doesn’t matter. Let the session continue till late.” Dhariwal then added, “Tum Kota ke ho b***c***. Kota mein rehna hai ke nahi rehna? (You are from Kota. Do you want to keep living in Kota or not),” as other members of the house laughed. Notably, Sharma is an MLA from South Kota.Arre tum Kota ke ho b#%* Kota me rehna hai ke nai tumhe: Congress MLA Shanti Dhariwal. pic.twitter.com/YuX7Tl173xShanti Dhariwal repeatedly used derogatory language in the legislative assembly. He made objectionable remarks in response to charges of wrongdoing during the Congress government and while talking on the issue of fake leases. When Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA from Nimbahera constituency Srichand Kripalani objected to his offensive utterances, he retorted, “Kripalani ji, You are my friend. Once you became a minister by mistake, you did not get the information. Now, listen to what I am saying and expand your knowledge.” BJP National Spokesperson Pratyush Kanth took to X (formerly Twitter) to slam the veteran Congressman and wrote, “This is senior Congress leader of Rajasthan, Shanti Dhariwal. He is threatening ‘Whether you want to stay in Kota or not, I will see,’ in the assembly. This is the honour of Congress for the post of Speaker which is a constitutional position.

There is no doubt in the fact that we are at number one in rape cases. Why are we ahead in rape cases? Is there some fault within us? What can we do? Rajasthan has always been the state of ‘mards’ (men),” he expressed in the legislative assembly as other members received the vile remarks with laughs.The National Commission of Women (NCW) Chairperson, Rekha Sharma, had declared that the minister would face severe consequences. She stated, “Rajasthan Government has ministers like these that’s why women of the state are suffering gruesome gender crimes and police just don’t do anything.

"25 July, 2024","Congress party distances itself from party MP and former Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi’s support to Khalistani MP Amripal Singh in Lok Sabha, says...",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/congress-party-distances-itself-from-its-mp-charanjit-singh-channis-support-to-khalistani-mp-amripal-singh-in-lok-sabha/,"Former Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi attacked the union govt in parliament for keeping Waris Punjab De chief and Khadoor Sahib Lok Sabha MP Amritpal Singh in jail. The Congress party has said that the comments made by party MP Charanjit Singh Channi in support of Khalistani MP Amirtpal Singh are his own and he does not represent the party’s views. Congress General Secretary in-charge Communications Jairam Ramesh posted a tweet distancing the party from Channi’s comments.“The views expressed by Charanjit Singh Channi, MP on Amritpal Singh are his own, and do not reflect in any way the position of the Indian National Congress,” Jairam Ramesh posted on X (Twitter).This comes after the former Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi attacked the union govt in parliament for keeping Waris Punjab De chief and Khadoor Sahib Lok Sabha MP Amritpal Singh in jail. Channi alleged that there is “undeclared emergency” under the Modi govt and claimed that “free speech” of the Khalistani leader was being curbed.Speaking during the debate on the Budget 2024, Charanjit Singh Channi said, “They (BJP) speak about Emergency every day. But what about the undeclared Emergency in the country today?…This too is Emergency that a man who was elected as an MP by 20 lakh people in Punjab is behind bars under the NSA. He is unable to present the views of the people of his constituency, here. This too is Emergency.”He alleged that there is an undeclared emergency in the nation while stating that Sidhu Moose Wala, one of the famous singers of the nation was killed and justice has not delivered to his family. Channi said, “Today in the country, a financial emergency-like condition is emerging and the BJP is responsible for that. They talk about the 1975 emergency but about today’s undeclared emergency in the country? It is also an emergency that Sidhu Moose Wala, one of the famous singers of the nation was killed and justice has not given to his family.”Notably, while Channi blamed the NDA govt at centre for Amritpal Singh’s arrest, the fact is Singh was arrested by Punjab Police and the NSA has been slapped against him by the Punjab govt run by AAP. Last month, the AAP govt in Punjab extended detention of Amritpal Singh and his nine aides, currently lodged in Dibrugarh Jail in Assam, by a year under the stringent National Security Act (NSA).The order was issued by Punjab government’s home affairs and justice department on 3rd June. Therefore, it is the Congress ally AAP govt which is keeping Amritpal Singh in jail, not the Modi govt at centre.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"27 July, 2024","As Bhim Army Chief Chandrashekhar Azad ‘Ravan’ pushes for private sector reservations, a look at the economic and social pitfalls of such a step",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/bhim-army-chief-chandrashekhar-azad-private-sector-reservations/,"The bill proposes that the Central government must incentivise private sector entities to implement reservations for SCs, STs, and OBCs by giving them special concessions and facilitating lower-interest loans through nationalised banks.On Friday (26th July), Azad Samaj Party MP from Uttar Pradesh’s Nagina and Bhim Army Chief, Chandra Shekhar Azad introduced a private member bill in Lok Sabha to extend reservations for the SCs, STs, and OBCs in the private sector. The bill is titled, ‘The Reservation for the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes and the Other Backward Classes in Private Sector Act, 2024’. आज मैने लोक सभा में 3 निम्नलिखित गैर सरकारी विधेयक पेश किए-1. निजी क्षेत्रों में अनुसूचित जातियों,अनुसूचित जनजातियों और अन्य पिछड़े वर्गों के लिये आरक्षण की व्यवस्था।2. अनुसूचित जातियों तथा अनुसूचित जनजातियों के बच्चों के लिये आवासीय स्कूल।3. देश मे सभी बालकों को उच्च एवम्… pic.twitter.com/25YDIPZ9ZwCurrently, reservations are only applicable in the public sector and there is no reservation in the private sector. The bill proposes to change this and extend reservation benefits to the SC, ST, and OBC communities in the private sector as well. The bill introduced by Bhim Army Chief Ravan seeks to extend reservations in the private sector, educational institutions, and other establishments that have no government financial interest and employ at least 20 people. The bill proposes that the Central government must incentivise private sector entities to implement reservations for SCs, STs, and OBCs by giving them special concessions and facilitating lower-interest loans through nationalised banks.It also proposes that the government should present an annual report in both houses of Parliament to highlight all actions that have been taken under the Act, in case it is passed by both houses as well as get Presidential assent. The proposed legislation also wants to make it mandatory for the Union government to frame rules to ensure the effective implementation of the Act (if passed). The bill claims to rely on support from Articles 16(4) and 16(4A) of the Constitution. Incidentally, the said article permits reservations in public sector undertakings (PSUs) and financial institutions receiving government grants.In his statement of objects and reasons, the Bhim Army Chief claimed that to ensure equitable growth and socio-economic upliftment, it is imperative to have representation from all sections of the society while highlighting the importance of the private sector in nation-building. Any Member of Parliament (MP) can also introduce proposed legislation in both houses of Parliament and it is known as the Private Members’ Bill. Just like any other bill proposed by the government, a Private Member bill, to become an act, must be passed by both houses and receive Presidential assent. Notably, such bills can only be introduced and discussed on Fridays. Yesterday (on 26th July), as many as 31 private members’ Bills were introduced in the Lok Sabha. Congress MP Shashi Tharoor also moved a private member bill seeking to reserve 10 seats in the Lok Sabha for those below 35 years of age.Today, I introduced three Private member’s bills in the Lok Sabha. One of them would reserve 10 seats in Parliament for people under the age of 35. We already hold the world record for the biggest gap between the average age of the population and the average age of Parliament. It… pic.twitter.com/T43PFDxkHTNonetheless, it is pertinent to note that while Bhim Army Chief Chandrashekhar Azad has proposed to extend reservations for SCs, STs, and OBCs in the private sector, the Congress government in Karnataka recently proposed to extend reservations in the private sector for Kannadigas. Strikingly, the Cabinet led by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah had decided to present seven bills, including 100% reservation for Kannadigas in Category C and D jobs in all private industries in the state. However, the legislation extending reservations in the private sector for Kannadigas triggered massive opposition from top Industry leaders and within the state government, forcing the state government to halt the proposed legislation for want of ‘further discussions’.Extending reservations, either for locals or the backward communities, in the private sector could have long-term and far-reaching consequences for the economy as well as the social fabric of the country. The proposed legislation would have a chilling effect on meritocracy, ease of doing business, and investment opportunities, as well as could lead to social unrest.As a well-established fact, India, or any other country plagued by Licence or quota raj, witnessed sluggish growth for several decades but it has grown leaps and bounds after the economic reforms in 1991 which liberalised the economy and unshackled private sector from needless legislative compliance. At a time when companies are opting out of China and relocating to countries that have skilled labour, stifling meritocracy for vote bank politics, and pushing reservations in the private sector would be catastrophic. This would not only be dragging India back in this highly competitive race of ‘free’ and open market access for new companies, it would be undoing the progress in economic and other key parameters of Human development post the liberalisation era. The strength of the private sector lies in the easy and flexible accessibility of factors of production, including skilled human resources. Barring the CSR aspect, the private sector links its outcomes with high standards of performance audits. However, with reservations in the private sector and elections always around the corner, companies would face mounting pressure from the ruling party in their state of operation to not fire employees despite audit reviews, as well as to improve recruitment from the communities forming political vote bank, thus putting a constraint on their say on Human resources.This has the potential to limit the functionality of companies causing them to find an exit route to ensure their profit margin and escape the wrath of the government’s and administration’s restrictive measures like the job quota compliance. The government/police intervention in the day-to-day functioning of the company’s operation to ensure compliance would render the companies prone to “corruption”, and “bureaucratic red-tapism”, and send the state/country back to the “License quota raj” period, pre-reform era.Furthermore, rather than striving to build an egalitarian society and uplift marginalised society, the bill’s introduction could lead to social unrest, like the protests during the Mandal era when reservations were made applicable only in the public sector which makes up roughly around 2% of the total workforce. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"25 July, 2024","The world remembers Akhlaq, but not Tejram: Here is how Tejram was lynched in Bareilly by a Muslim mob over stopping them from playing...",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/tejram-lynching-in-bareilly-by-a-muslim-mob-on-muharram-up-police-buldozer-action-stone-pelting-firing/,"The media bias contributes to the perpetuation of a narrative wherein Muslims are permanent victims while Hindus are disregarded. Furthermore, it denies victims equal respect and justice because their cases do not receive the attention and advocacy that would help in getting justice for Hindu victims.On Muharram this year, several incidents of mob violence and raising of slogans like ‘Sar tan se juda’ or ‘Hindustan mein rehna hai to Allah hu Akbar kehna hai” have been reported in various parts of India. However, there was no “idea of India khatre mein hai” or “lynchistan” type outrage on the ground or on social media. Why? Because the victims were Hindus and the perpetrators were Islamists. In Uttar Pradesh’s Bareilly district, an incident of mob lynching has been reported wherein a Hindu youth named Tejram was brutally lynched by a Muslim mob on 18th July after Hindus objected to Muslims playing “dhol” outside a Hindu temple during a Muharram procession on 17th July in Gausganj area.An altercation ensued over Hindus stopping Muslims from playing Dhol [drums] in front of a Hindu temple on 17th July during the Muharram procession. The accused Muslims then started attacking the Hindus and pelting stones at their houses and harassing the women. The ruckus had continued even after the arrival of the police. The Muslims later called more people from Rampur, CB Ganj, Mirganj, Devarniya and other neighbouring areas and attacked Hindu houses on the night of Friday with stones, sticks and other things.During the attack on Hindus by accused Muslims on the night of July 18th, Tejram sustained severe injuries on the head. An IndiaToday report said that some 80-100 persons arrived in the Gausganj neighbourhood and began pelting stones, breaking into houses, vandalising them, and beating up the residents. The villagers said that the Muslim attackers dragged Tejram from his house to the mosque and brutally thrashed the 26-year-old youth. Tejram’s family has said that he was attempting to defuse the matter. The Hindu youth was rushed to the hospital, however, Shahi Police Station in-charge Amit Kumar said that the victim succumbed to his injuries during treatment. Subsequently, the deceased victim’s body was sent for postmortem examination.The postmortem report mentions the brutality inflicted by the attackers during the lynching of Tejram. The report said that the skull bones of victim Tejram were damaged during the mob lynching as a result of strikes from large stones and iron rods, and blood clots had developed in his brain. While Tejram was trying to escape, his both hands and shoulders bleeding.After the mob violence, a case was then filed by the Hindu community against 50 identified individuals and 15 unidentified individuals. The Police eventually began an investigation into the case and arrested around 35 persons including Afsar Ali, Imran, Mukhtiar Ali, Abdul, Salam, and others. When police tried to arrest some accused, the accused had opened fire on police personnel too. The police had to open retaliatory fire. This resulted in injury to one of the accused identified as Alamgir. After this incident, one Najakat Ali was also arrested by the police. A constable was injured by shrapnel in the firing.On Tuesday (23rd July), the district administration of Uttar Pradesh’s Bareilly razed over nine houses belonging to the Muslim accused in the case. Before this, the administration demolished 11 buildings belonging to the accused persons after finding that they constructed houses on Gram Samaj’s government land. During the demolition drive, the house of the main accused Bakhtawar was also razed to the ground. In addition, the illegal houses of accused Babu, Hasan Ali, Kader Ali, Hanif, Haseen, and Riyasat have also been marked for demolition.थाना शाही क्षेत्रान्तर्गत ग्राम गौसगंज में दिनांक 19.07.2024 को घटित घटना के सम्बन्ध में पंजीकृत अभियोगो में 35 अभियुक्तों की गिरफ्तार आदि की कार्यवाही होने के सम्बन्ध में पुलिस अधीक्षक दक्षिणी बरेली की बाइट।#UPPolice pic.twitter.com/BeJjVLJAvgDo you remember Akhlaq? Do you remember Pehlu Khan? Yes, you do! These names have been etched in your memory since the entire media, left-liberal ecosystem and political vultures made sure you do, and feel “ashamed as a Hindu” and guilty. A mere mention of these two names refreshes one’s memory of how the anti-Hindu cabal and placard gang berated Hindustan as “lynchistan” to assert that somehow the Muslim ‘minority’ is no longer safe under the Modi-led ‘Hindutva’ government.When incidences like the alleged lynching of Akhlaq in 2015 and cow smuggler Pehlu Khan occurred in 2017, there was massive criticism, media coverage, and outrage from a variety of sources, including liberals and self-proclaimed ‘human rights’ activists. Akhlaq’s lynching, in which he was suspected of storing beef, became a national issue, sparking debates about intolerance and mob violence in India against ‘minorities’ even as it turned out that while Akhlaq’s family had claimed the meat in question was mutton, the final report on the same confirmed it was from a cow. However, similar outrage and attention appear to be non-existent in the case of the lynching of Tejaram since he was a Hindu lynched by those belonging to an ‘oppressed’ minority. A man named Tabrez beaten to death in Jharkhand in 2019 over allegations of theft sparked more outrage than over a Hindu youth who spoke for his community being lynched by Muslims. While news anchors conducted primetime debates to peddle the ‘darr ka mahaul’ narrative, long op-eds were written by anti-Hindu pens for hire in Indian and Western media passing off incidents of violence over cattle smuggling allegations as the lynching of Muslims by ‘Hindutva’ mobs, there is deafening ‘secular’ silence over the horrific lynching of Tejaram in Bareilly. Except for a few journalists, the mainstream media which takes delight in preaching to Hindus how they are becoming ‘intolerant’, is absolutely mum over a Hindu man’s lynching by Muslims, and incidents involving the raising of murderous ‘Sar tan se juda’ slogans during Muharram processions. You will not see primetime debates with ‘experts’ discussing where the country is heading.If you have not heard about Teja Ram’s brutal lynching by Islamists on Moharram, I don’t blame you. “Secular silence”, as @AmanChopra_ puts it, is very real. Have a look at how the news is blacked out totally even by Google. pic.twitter.com/Zu7383W13oWhile Hindus have the least expectations from biased media publications, their silence on incidents of religiously motivated violence against Hindus is dangerous. Their silence contributes to the normalisation of anti-Hindu violence. If narrative building is an art, Islamists and their media allies are its Picasso. On the one hand, Islamists and Muslim ‘journalists’ stir outrage even by peddling fake ‘mob lynching by Hindus’ narrative over incidents wherein the deceased happens to be a Muslim with no communal angle whatsoever, on the other, incidents of violence against Hindus do not get enough attention forget outrage and even the media forgets such incidents after one or two short articles or mentioning them in ‘100 fatafat’ news on television.The media bias contributes to the perpetuation of a narrative wherein Muslims are permanent victims while Hindus are disregarded. Furthermore, it denies victims equal respect and justice because their cases do not receive the attention and advocacy that would help in getting justice for Hindu victims. Apparently, the biased media and Hindu-hating political parties have successfully established the narrative that there are two types of mob lynching: one is “communal lynching” wherein the victim happens to be a Muslim regardless of the existence of any communal angle or not, and the other is “secular lynching” wherein Hindus are the victims of mob violence by Muslims. They have managed to convince the public that somehow only alleged ‘communal lynching’ is worth street protests, candle marches, social media outrage, primetime debates, celebrities crying ‘Not my India’ etc. It seems that the incidents of anti-Hindu violence are being deliberately downplayed to convince the Hindus that only the Muslim ‘minority’ can be victims and since Hindus are the majority community they are by default the oppressors.Just imagine the outrage had Tejram’s name been Tabarez and it was the occasion of Ram Navami or Hanuman Jayanti instead of Muharram. Notably, in what seems like a deliberate cover-up, most mainstream media reports did not even mention that Tejaram was lynched allegedly inside a mosque. No wonder, the killers of Kamlesh Tiwari get bail while the deceased Hindu is forgotten while death anniversaries of cow smugglers and cow meat hoarders are observed by Islamists every year. The short-term memory of Hindus further helps them in downplaying anti-Hindu violence and whitewashing the crimes of Islamists as well as using the desperation of Hindus to hold moral high ground to guilt trip them over incidents wherein the deceased happens to be Muslim. Hindus are definitely losing the narrative battle despite being persecuted while Islamists, with the help of their media allies and politicians continue to control the narrative and even influence elections by playing perpetual victimhood. So far, the cases of grooming jihad [also called love jihad] are dismissed as ‘fiction’, ‘hoax’ and ‘conspiracy theory’, soon the cases of anti-Hindu violence will also be given similar tags.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"23 July, 2024","Milords, you had a choice to eat in a restaurant you like, we want the same choice and clarity while making a purchase",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/supreme-court-stay-order-up-uttarakhand-street-vendor-eatery-name-display/,"Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing the petitioners further contended that the display of the name itself cannot be seen as a measure to ensure vegetarian food. Furthermore, any such directive coming without any support from the Constitutional or legal provisions would infringe the secular character and Articles 14, 15(1) and 17 of the Constitution.On 22nd July, the Supreme Court of India gave interim relief to the petitioners against the Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand governments’ directives to prominently display the names of the owners of the shop and carts. While Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand governments issued directives for the Kanwar Yatra Path, Madhya Pradesh’s Ujjain administration gave directives for the shops and carts outside the Mahakal Temple.During the argument, an interesting trivia came to light. The matter was heard by Justice Hrishikesh Roy and Justice SVN Bhatti. It was mentioned by Justice Bhatti that he used to go to a vegetarian hotel operated by a Muslim over the one operated by a Hindu citing ‘hygiene standards’.He said, “Without disclosing the city’s name I will share it with you. In Kerala, there were two vegetarian hotels, one by Hindu and one by Muslim. I went to the latter because he was maintaining international standards. He was a Dubai returnee. But he displayed everything on the board.” [The quote is a mix of X posts made by Live Law and Bar & Bench]Singhvi: Hundreds are losing their jobs. We have to wake up and smell the coffee. Idea is to exclude not just one minority but Dalits as well.Justice Roy: What is the expectation of the Kanwariyas? They worship Shiva, yes? Do they expect the food to be cooked and served and…In short, Justice Bhatti made a firm choice based on the information displayed on a board to choose a Muslim hotelier over a Hindu hotelier because the former was maintaining “International Standards” of hygiene. Justice Bhatti had the choice of selecting the hotelier with a complete set of information including his religion.J Bhatti: There is one veg hotel run by a Hindu, and one run by a Muslim…in Kerala…As the judge of that state, I used to go the one run by the Muslim. He was maintaining international standards#SupremeCourt #KanwarYatraNow the question arises, if Justice Bhatti can have the choice and clarity while choosing the restaurant, why did the two-judge bench, which he was part of, deny the same right to Hindu pilgrims performing Kanwar Yatra? For those who are unaware, devotees performing Kanwar Yatra are supposed to eat only Satvik food. They must follow certain rules which they may break in case enough information is not available.The interim stay imposed by the Supreme Court was based on the contention that the directives were “discriminatory” and would cause untouchability. Interestingly, on social media, it has been argued that Kanwariyas would also avoid eating at restaurants run by Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes OBCs etc. One may ask what proof or evidence they provided. The answer is none.Anyway, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing the petitioners further contended that the display of the name itself cannot be seen as a measure to ensure vegetarian food. Furthermore, any such directive coming without any support from the Constitutional or legal provisions would infringe the secular character and Articles 14, 15(1) and 17 of the Constitution. While these contentions were accepted by the apex court, there was no thought of mind implying the fact that Hindus too have the right to choose where they want to eat or buy anything.Furthermore, while discussing the above aspects, Justice Bhatti also mentioned that “some non-vegetarians” prefer Halal-certified meat. Halal is a religious term used for meat produced as per Sharia law or Islamic laws. Only a Muslim can ensure the meat is Halal. Judges were aware that food choices are prominently dependent on religion. Without taking the name of the Muslims, Justice Bhatti pointed out that Muslims make an informed choice to choose Halal meat over Jhatka or unlabelled. How do they know that the meat is Halal? Meat shop owners mention it in bold letters.Justice Bhatti: We understand the distinction between good and bad here. Some non-vegetarians prefer halal certified meat. What I see is that you previously mentioned you couldn’t answer my brother’s question with a simple yes or no.AM Singhvi: It is mostly yes. They have…Halal meat is so widely available and has become the first choice of famous food chains that it is extremely difficult for Hindus and Sikhs to find Jhatka meat. They have to make extra effort to ask if the meat is Jhatka or not. As Halal meat is butchered only by a Muslim, it leads to a loss of jobs for Hindu and Sikh butchers. Only a few Butchers of Hindu or Sikh community are left but it has never been questioned. Hindus are in majority in India. The population of meat-eating Hindus surpass Muslims. Still, Hindus are forced intentionally or unintentionally to eat Halal meat. In this case, what about the rights of Hindus? Are they not valid?One needs two hands to clap. Certain rules about dietary habits and choices cannot be imposed continuously in a biased manner favouring only one community. Hindus must get the right to choose where they want to eat and from whom they want to buy fruits or any other item. It has to be based on the information publically available, preferably prominently written on boards outside shops and carts.There is another aspect of the order. The Supreme Court pointed out that a competent food authority should have passed the order in the matter. The court said, “It is permissible for the authorities to ensure that the Kanwariyas are served vegetarian food conforming to the preferences and also ensure hygienic standards. In furtherance to this, the competent authority may perhaps issue orders under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 and the Street Vendors Act, 2014. However, the legal powers vested on the competent authority cannot be usurped by the Police, without legal foundation.” In short, if FSSAI issues directive to prominently display names of the owners and workers at the restaurant or carts, the apex court will not have a problem with it. Sadly, there was no one from any of the three governments, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand, to represent the matter in the Supreme Court even though all three governments have counsels on payroll in the apex court. The next date of hearing in the matter is 26th July.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

"23 July, 2024","Innocence exploited – How NewsLaundry lied and defamed Hindu activist Bittu Bajrangi, who spoke to them in good faith",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/newslaundry-lied-defamed-hindu-bittu-bajrangi-spoke-to-them-in-good-faith-nuh-violence/,"While granting bail to Bittu, the court noted, “It has nowhere been pointed out that as to whether these weapons were being used to cause violence on the spot or to inflict any injury either to the policemen or to any people of a particular community. No such allegations are there. Snatching of such articles/weapons from the policemen is also highly improbable.” Bittu Bajrangi was accused under sections 148, 149, 332, 353, 186, 395, 397, 506, 25, 54, and 59 of the IPC in connection with the Nuh violence incident.On Saturday, 20th July, propaganda portal Newslaundry published a video interview with Gaurakshak Bajrang Force chief Bittu Bajrangi. While speaking to Bittu, Newslaundry’s reporter Avdesh Kumar spoke to him politely but the agenda with which he approached the interview was sinister.Violence broke out in Nuh during a jalabhishek yatra in July last year, killing six people. Key accused Bittu Bajrangi is set to lead the same yatra today.Catch the cow vigilante in conversation with @ImAvdheshkumar: https://t.co/Mlmg1HouAB pic.twitter.com/drH6xJ1h93The title of the video interview reads, “The main accused of Nuh riots and out on bail Bittu Bajrangi to organize Jalabhishek Yatra again”. The description of the video, which was in Hindi, read, “Bittu Bajrangi, the main accused in the violence that occurred on July 31 last year, is personally inviting people to participate in this procession. We spoke to Bittu Bajrangi in detail about this matter. It should be noted that the violence in Nuh, Haryana, last year created a climate of concern across the state and the country. This violence occurred during a religious procession when a minor dispute between two communities suddenly escalated. Six people lost their lives, and many were injured in the violence.”The description further read, “Bittu Bajrangi, known as a Gau Rakshak, was prominently implicated in this incident. He also runs an organization called Gau Raksha Bajrang Force. Last year, he was arrested on charges of inciting violence and playing an active role in it. The police and administration considered him one of the main accused. Bittu Bajrangi participated in the religious procession during which the violence started. He is accused of inciting his supporters and encouraging them to engage in violent activities. Immediately after the violence, Bittu Bajrangi was taken into police custody, and multiple charges were filed against him. He is currently out on bail.”OpIndia talked to Bittu Bajrangi to get his views on the title and description. He said, “I am heartbroken. I will be vigilant next time before agreeing to an interview”. From his statement, it is evident that he was unaware of how he was going to be presented in the video.No one is denying that there are several cases filed against Bittu Bajrangi, especially linked to his Gau Raksha work. However, in this case, Newslaundry has presented him as if he was the one solely responsible for the Nuh violence that took place on 31st July 2023. OpIndia accessed court documents, including his bail orders by the Sessions Court. There was no mention that he was the main accused. As the order read, Usha [Kundu], HPS Additional Superintendent of Police, Nuh, was posted on the day of the incident. She noticed Bittu and his accomplices coming towards the temple to join the procession.She pointed out in her complaint that Bittu and his accomplices were carrying swords and Trishul-like weapons which were confiscated by the police. After the police confiscated the swords and Trishul, Bittu and his accomplices got into an altercation with the police and staged a protest by sitting on the road in front of the police vehicle. It was then alleged that they forcefully took the weapons away. Defense counsel appearing for Bittu argued that the alleged weapons were just symbols that were carried for display.  While granting bail to Bittu, the court noted, “It has nowhere been pointed out that as to whether these weapons were being used to cause violence on the spot or to inflict any injury either to the policemen or to any people of a particular community. No such allegations are there. Snatching of such articles/weapons from the policemen is also highly improbable.” Bittu Bajrangi was accused under sections 148, 149, 332, 353, 186, 395, 397, 506, 25, 54, and 59 of the IPC in connection with the Nuh violence incident.It was nowhere mentioned in the FIR that Bittu Bajrangi used the weapons or inflicted any injuries on police personnel or people of a particular community.Notably, a trial in the matter has started in the Sessions court and a non-bailable warrant was issued against Bittu as he failed to appear in court via video conferencing. His counsel argued there was some miscommunication but NBW was issued by the court. However, that still does not prove that he played any role in the violence.Newslaundry’s description lacks facts. They mentioned that six people were killed but did not mention what was the reason behind it. Newslaundry failed to mention that a Hindu boy named Abhishek was shot dead and then beheaded by an Islamist mob. Abhishek’s head was then crushed with a stone. Newslaundry did not make a video explaining how an Islamist mob attacked a cybercrime police station or how a female judge was attacked during the violence by the Islamist mob when she was traveling with her daughter. Shops of Hindus were burnt to the ground, Hindu pilgrims were made hostages in a temple, and police personnel and home guards were killed by the riotous Islamist mob. This is how propaganda works and Newslaundry is an expert in it.As mentioned earlier, no one is denying the cases against Bittu. He mentioned that there are around eight cases currently pending against him and he has been in and out of jail over such cases. But that does not nullify the fact that he has tirelessly worked for the welfare of the Hindu community including Gau Raksha. While propaganda portals do not skip a breath before mentioning terrorists like Afzal Guru as a professor or riot-accused Umar Khalid as a “student activist”, when it comes to Hindu activists like Bittu, they present them as no less than terrorists, while hiding the crimes of the Islamists against which those like Bittu Bajrangi act in defense. Hundreds and thousands of Hindu activists are misrepresented by the left-leaning media which often distorts their intentions and work. Take the example of this interview. The NL reporter kept pressing Bittu to “reveal” his political affiliation. Bittu pointed out that he works independently without any political affiliation or “sar par haath” per se.Kumar kept asking if he was associated with RSS, BJP, or VHP. Bittu clearly said that he is inspired by these organizations and attached to them in one way or another. When the reporter said VHP has “disowned” him, Bittu said, “When a family member does something wrong, the elders of the family say in anger ‘he is not part of our family’. That does not necessarily mean that the person who did wrong has been disowned”. The argument visibly rattled the reporter, and he changed his course of questions.From the use of foul language to alleged derogatory social media posts, Kumar did not leave any stone unturned to agitate Bittu during the interview. Bittu at one point said, “I am a very calm person who does not use foul language. However if someone acts against the Hindu community, I may get angry”. He admitted he gets angry but that does not mean he uses foul language every time he speaks, something which Newslaundry’s reporter wanted to present.What could be the aim of such an interview that too just a couple of days before the scheduled Brijmandal Yatra? The aim was simple. Newslaundry wanted to set a narrative that Bittu Bajrangi was the key accused and reason for Nuh’s violence last year. In case anything happens during the 2024 Yatra, the blame would have again gone to Hindu activists. Unfortunately for Newslaundry and fortunately for Bittu, he was not granted permission to attend Yatra. It was one of his bail conditions that he would not visit Nuh until the trial was over, which could have led to the denial of the permission, this, despite there being no proof of his involvement in any violence during the Nuh Yatra, and there being plenty of evidence of the violence unleashed by the Muslim mob.One can only hope nothing happens during the ongoing Brijmandal Yatra as 5,000 police personnel have been deployed by the Haryana government to avoid any sort of agitation or violence. In a country where Hindus are supposedly a majority, they need protection from the police (in the case of Brijmandal Yatra) and the Army (in the case of Amarnath Yatra) to participate in a pilgrimage which speaks volumes about the reality of the situation.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"22 July, 2024",Mamata Banerjee and her unhealthy obsession with not being a kafir and ‘fighting kafirs’: Here’s how she peddled the dangerous line earlier,https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/mamata-banerjee-her-unhealthy-obsession-with-not-being-a-kafir-and-fighting-kafirs/,"CM Banerjee said: “Jo darte hai wo marte hai, Jo ladte hai wo Kamyab hote hai, hum darpok nhi hai, hum kafir nhi hai, hum gaddar nhi hai.” (Translation – Those who get scared end up losing, while those who put up a fight achieve victory, we are not cowards, we are not kafir.)“What Bengal thinks today India thinks tomorrow”: This popular saying of freedom fighter Gopal Krishna Gokhale boasted Bengal’s cultural and intellectual richness, in the present context sounds no less than a “warning”. Imagine a sitting Chief Minister using a pejorative term used by a religious community to dehumanise others to boast about her bravery. Well, you don’t need to imagine, since this is the new normal, the new reality of West Bengal. On the 21st of July, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee while speaking at TMC’s ‘Martyr’s Day’ event said that she is not a Kafir and went on to equate Kafirs with cowards. CM Banerjee said: “Jo darte hai wo marte hai, Jo ladte hai wo Kamyab hote hai, hum darpok nhi hai, hum kafir nhi hai, hum gaddar nhi hai.” (Translation – Those who get scared end up losing, while those who put up a fight achieve victory, we are not cowards, we are not kafir.)Such desperation to prove her pro-Muslim credentials that Mamata Banerjee, voted and elected as the state’s representative by people of various religious communities, ended up declaring all of them except Muslims as “Kafirs” [infidels] and cowards.It is pertinent to understand, especially for those labelled as “Kafirs” what exactly the term means before delving into why it is outrageous for a ‘democratic’ leader holding a constitutional post to use this jibe against her political adversaries.“The word Kufr means to reject faith in God, God’s signs, the prophets, the Holy Scriptures and the Day of Judgment. One who does not have faith in the unity of God and does not have faith also in other sacred signs of God is a Kafir, according to the Quran. One who rejects faith in God or does not have faith in God is called a Kafir. A Kafir may also be an idolater who worships gods and goddesses. According to the Quran, they are those who have gone astray. There are about 350 verses about Kufr and Kafir. In the majority of the verses, Kufr is non-belief in one God and prophets of God and the Holy Scriptures. Kufr is also worship of idols and gods and goddesses other than God. In some of the verses, the word Kufr and its variations are used to mean ingratitude for the favours of God. It is natural that if someone does not recognize God or does not have faith in God, he will also not acknowledge God’s favours but will attribute the favours to his gods and goddesses,” this is how New Age Islam, an Islamic reformist organisation describes Kufr and Kafir. Here God without an “s” is used for Allah.In a country where millions of Hindus who are polytheists and worship their deities using idols reside, a Chief Minister finds “Kafir” the most appropriate term to attack her political rivals. This, however, is not the first and certainly not going to be the last time Banerjee used this slur against non-Muslims.On 22nd January 2024, the day Prime Minister Narendra Modi performed the Pran Pratishtha of Ramlala at Ayodhya Ram Mandir, a historic day of reclamation for Hindus, Mamata Banerjee issued a stern warning to those who support or vote for BJP saying that Allah will not forgive them and that only Kafirs fear, but those who fight they win. “Ek bat yaad rakhna, BJP ko madad mat karna, BJP ko agar tum log madad karoge koi to Allah ki kasam aap logo ko koi mafi nhi karega hum to mafi nhi karenge.” (Translated – Do remember one thing, don’t support/assist/vote for BJP. I am swearing on Allah if you help/assist BJP, nobody would forgive you, let alone me.) “Jo Kafir hain, woh darte hain, Jo ladte hain, woh jeet te hain,” Banerjee said.Irony died a painful death as Mamata Banerjee made these remarks at a ‘Sarv Dharm Sambhav’ rally.Similarly, in May 2022, a video of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee went viral on social media where she was addressing the crowd on the occasion of Eid. During her address, she said something that sounded like ‘Kafir’. She said, “Let them do what they want. We are not scared. We are not cowards. We are not ‘Kafir’ [possibly]. We fight. We know how to fight. We will fight against them. We will finish them.”Who would have thought that the idea of respecting all religions emanates from labelling non-Muslims as Kafirs and cowards? The Quran and Islamic scholars say that anyone who does not believe in Allah, his messenger and the judgement day is a Kafir and his ‘sins’ are unforgivable. These Kafirs, who do not believe in Allah become Mushrikeens when they worship Gods other than Allah.Islamic terrorists and ‘unarmed’ Islamists often use the term “Kafir” to subjugate Hindus and other non-Muslims as well as to justify their violent attacks on ‘infidels’.Banerjee’s usage of ‘Kafir’ goes beyond mere political jabs. It is a potent symbol of religious exclusion and conflict. CM Banerjee’s choice of words is not incidental but rather a deliberate strategy to solidify her support base among Muslims by framing political battles in religious terms. The Trinamool Congress supremo knows that making such opprobrious remarks won’t trigger protests of the same intensity if anyone said something slightly critical about Muslims. The streets of India have witnessed widespread protests, effigy-burnings and violence over a Hindu woman and BJP’s former spokesperson Nupur Sharma for merely stating facts often mentioned by Islamic scholars and the Islamic texts.Mamata Banerjee’s statements during such public events suggest that she is fighting against ‘Kafirs,’ positioning herself and her supporters as the true believers against an opposing ‘other.’ This language feeds into a larger narrative of religious and cultural conflict, which is particularly dangerous in a multi-religious society like India where the peaceful Hindu majority is perpetually subjected to scrutiny for their religious beliefs and customs, gaslighting in the event Muslims get offended over Hindus celebrating their festivals like Ram Navami in ‘Muslim areas’ and resort to stone pelting and violence. CM Banerjee’s statements alienate Hindus by casting them as the ‘cowards and infidels’ fostering a sense of exclusion and division in the land of Hindus, in the land of Swami Vivekanand.While framing political opponents as ‘Kafirs’ promotes intolerance and bigotry against Hindus and other non-Muslims in addition to dehumanising them, this bigotry has been mainstreamed in the TMC-ruled state. OpIndia has reported several incidents wherein the state government demonstrated its blatant favouritism towards Muslims and disdain towards Hindus. It was reported last year, that a Durga Mandir was found blocked and barricaded in Kaliachak town in Malda district of West Bengal. The development came a day before the Islamic month of Muharram. Before this, CM Mamata Banerjee imposed restrictions on the immersion of Durga idols in 2016 and 2017 to make way for Muharram processions. The burden of upholding the farcical ‘secularism’ lies on the shoulders of Hindus, since the state itself makes it a matter of “Us vs Kafirs” and deems Kafirs as cowards. Just imagine the outrage liberals and Islamists would unleash if a BJP leader says he/she is not a coward or not a Mleccha.While there are numerous incidents, let’s discuss a recent incident to understand how the Islamisation of West Bengal is being normalised unchecked. TMC leader and a Cabinet Minister in the state government, Firhad Hakim derided non-Muslims as ‘unfortunate’ and openly called for their religious conversion to Islam. “Those who were not born into Islam were born with misfortune. If we can give them Dawat (call for proselytization) and bring Iman (Faith) in them, then, we will make Allah happy. We need to spread Islam among non-Muslims. If we can bring someone on the path of Islam, then, we will prove to be true Muslims by ensuring the spread of Faith,” said Firhad Hakim who is also Mamata Banerjee’s close aide.When a state minister openly gives the call for converting ‘unfortunate’ non-Muslims to Islam to make his God happy, Mamata Banerjee calling BJP leaders or non-Muslims in general Kafirs is not shocking. Hakim has earlier called for the “Urduisation” of Bengal. In addition, he once called BJP leaders and the Central Armed Forces “Suar ke bacche” [progeny of pig]. It is widely known that Muslims despise pigs and even eating pork is considered “haram” in Islam.No wonder a TMC MLA Hamidul Rahman’s alleged close associate Tajemul Haque alias JCB holds an ‘Insaf Sabha’ brutally assaults a woman in public and the TMC MLA justifies this Taliban-style flogging by saying that there are some ‘codes’ in a ‘Muslim Rashtra’. Apparently, in their heads and actions, the Islamists and their cheerleaders have already assumed West Bengal to be an ‘Islamic nation’ and it seems only an official declaration is awaited.Even before declaring her political opponents as “Kafirs”, Mamata Banerjee had selected 16th August to observe ‘Khela Hobe Diwas’, the day which coincided with ‘Direct Action Day’ to launch her campaign to remove BJP from power in various states ahead of the elections. CM Banerjee had then said that the “Khela Hobe” slogan would now be used on the national stage and declared that “Khela” would now happen in all states until the BJP is removed from the country.Incidentally, 16th August is the day when Muhammad Ali Jinnah called on Muslims throughout India to observe the Direct Action Day, also known as the 1946 Calcutta Killings, when thousands of Hindus were butchered by Islamists of the Muslims Leagues on the streets of Kolkata. Two months after the Trinamool Congress (TMC) swept the West Bengal State Legislative polls, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee announced to commemorate her election slogan in the form of ‘Khela Hobe Diwas‘.Mocking Hindus, dehumanising political opponents using Islamist slurs, and warning people that Allah will not forgive them, West Bengal under the TMC government has become opposed to its vibrant cultural identity.Mamata Banerjee’s repeated use of the term ‘Kafir’ is not just a political statement but a significant threat to the social fabric of India. It reflects an unhealthy obsession with religious identity and an attempt to appease the Muslim voter base at the cost of broader societal cohesion. As the Chief Minister, her responsibility should be to unite the people of West Bengal and address their collective needs rather than resorting to such polarising tactics. This desperation to prove to the Muslim vote bank that she is one of their own and others are ‘Kafir’, does not exemplify her ‘secular’ mindset but the extent to which the TMC is willing to go to retain power. On one hand, Mamata Banerjee randomly recites Chandi Paath to fool Hindus on the other, exposing her Islamist sympathising mindset. This mindset is no different from Islamic terrorists who want to subjugate non-Muslims to turn India into a Dar-ul-Islam.Ironically, from calling opponents Kafirs, Hindus “Hinsak” [violent] to calling Sanatan Dharma as “Dengue, Malaria” and calling for its eradication, the opposition parties and their leaders are deemed ‘defenders’ of Indian democracy and ‘idea of India’ and champions of constitution while the party following and respecting the democratic processes without slandering any religious community is labelled as ‘fascist, communal, bigot, and whatnot by the opposition friendly pens for hire and the extended ‘ecosystem’.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Even the bell was not rung to mark it pic.twitter.com/P4N3oSOhBkMeanwhile, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told ANI that it is “completely false” of Mamata Banerjee to claim that her microphone was switched off and claimed that every chief minister at the meeting was “allotted their due time to speak.”“CM Mamata Banerjee attended the Niti Aayog meeting. We all heard her. Every CM was given the allotted time and that was displayed on the screen which was present before every table…She said in the media that her mic was put off. That is completely false, ” Sitharaman told ANI.“Every CM was given their due time to speak…It’s unfortunate that the chief minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee has claimed that her mic was switched off which is not true…She should speak the truth behind this rather than again build a narrative based on falsehood,” the Union Finance Minister said.According to the government fact check body PIB, Mamata Banerjee’s turn to speak would be only after lunch if one goes alphabetically but she was “accomodated” as the seventh speaker on an official request from the Chief Minister.“Alphabetically, CM, West Bengal turn would have come after lunch. She was accommodated as the 7th speaker on an official request of the West Bengal government as she had to return early,” PIB Fact Check explained in a subsequent tweet.Earlier today speaking to reporters, the West Bengal Chief Minister alleged “political discrimination” and said that at the NITI Aayog meeting she was not allowed to speak for more than five minutes while other chief ministers were given more time.“…I said you (central government) should not discriminate against state governments. I wanted to speak but my mic was muted. I was allowed to speak only for five minutes. People before me spoke for 10-20 minutes,” Banerjee told reporters after she stormed out of the NITI Aayog meeting today.“I was the only one from the opposition who was participating but still, I was not allowed to speak. This is insulting…,” Banerjee said as she walked out mid way from the meeting.“I have come out boycotting the NITI Aayog meeting. Chandrababu Naidu was given 20 minutes to speak, Chief Ministers of Assam, Goa, Chhattisgarh spoke for 10-12 minutes. I was stopped after just 5 minutes. This is unfair,” the Chief Minister said speaking to reporters after coming out of the meeting.Claiming that she had chosen to participate in the meeting to strengthen “cooperative federalism” Banerjee said, “There are many regional aspirations. That is why I am here, to share those aspirations. If a state is strong, the Union will be strong.”The Chief Minister said that several states, including West Bengal, were deprived in the Union Budget that was presented in Parliament this week,Asking the central government to treat states equally, Banerjee said, “Bengal has been deprived of MNREGA funds for the last three years, nothing was paid. Treat all states equally. I said that today. I am speaking on behalf of all the states which have been deprived.”Hitting out at the central government over the Budget, the Chief Minister said that the Centre does not support “cooperative federalism.”“From the Opposition side, I am here to strengthen cooperative federalism. But you are not for cooperative federalism. The Budget is totally politically biased. Why discriminate against other states?” Banerjee said.The Trinamool Congress supremo also asked the Centre to give financial powers to NITI Aayog or bring back the Planning Commission.“NITI Aayog has no financial powers, how will it work? Give it financial powers, or bring back the Planning Commission,” she said.Chief Ministers of opposition-led states including Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Telangana, Delhi and Punjab boycotted the NITI Aayog meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.On Wednesday, Chief Minister of Punjab Bhagwant Mann and Telangana Chief Minister Revanth Reddy said that their government will boycott the NITI Aayog in protest against the central government’s alleged injustice to the state in the allocation of funds in the 2024 Union Budget.(This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

In Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, a helpless farmer kept making rounds of government offices, but his plea was not heard anywhere. At some places bribe was demanded and at other places people were sent away without any hearing. Ultimately, fed up, the farmer was forced to take this step. It is a well known fact that BJP and Narendra Modi are anti-farmer, it has been proved again today,” Congress posted.Shankarlal, dressed in a worn-out dhoti, was spotted rolling on the floor of the Collectorate office with his hands folded, muttering, “What should we do now?” as officials and visitors looked on.The old farmer claimed that despite numerous complaints, no action had been taken. He said that the alleged “inaction” of the officials prompted him to roll in the Collectorate’s halls to draw attention towards his plight. “A local land mafia is troubling me. The Tehsildar makes a mistake, and the farmer suffers. They make the mistakes, and I suffer the consequences. I am unhappy with the government and the administration. The officers here are corrupt. We are so troubled… farmers are being cheated,” Shankarlal said.During a public hearing on Tuesday, Shankarlal filed an application with the district administration. Dismissing the claims of inaction by officials, the Mandsaur administration clarified that farmer Shankarlal continues to hold possession of the said land.In an official statement, the Collector of Mandsaur Dilip Kumar said, “The applicant Shankar Lal, son of Phoolchand, is himself in possession of 1/2 of his land. The administration received the application sympathetically and heard the matter. Based on the facts, no person/land mafia has occupied the applicant’s land.

The transfer of the aforementioned land was authorised by the then Tehsildar, Sitamau, in the 2010-11 transfer registry. However, Karu Lal, Ramlal, Prabhu Lal, Mangi Bai, and Parvati Bai continue to hold the sold land and its possession has not been taken over by Ashwin.“After examination, the facts regarding the application are that the land situated in village Surkheda, survey number 604 and 625, total area 3.52 hectares, was registered in the hands of joint account holders Shankar Lal, Anokhi Lal, Bhagwan Bai, Reshambai, son of Phoolchand, 1/2 and Sampatbai, widow of Ghasiram, Karulal, Ramlal Prabhu Lal, Mangi Bai, Parvati Bai, son of Ghasi, his share was 1/2.

"13 July, 2024",Congress spokesperson spreads fake news that BSNL made profits during UPA govt and suffering losses under the BJP: Here is the truth,https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/congress-spokesperson-lies-that-bsnl-made-profit-during-upa-and-suffered-loss-during-nda/,"The claim that BSNL was profiting in 2013, the last full financial year when the UPA government was in power is “Fake”. It is pertinent to note that BSNL’s profit steeply started declining after 2005 and FY 2009-10 was the first time when BSNL started incurring losses. Recently, Congress Spokesperson and National Secretary of the Indian Youth Congress, Roshni Kushal Jaiswal shared a short video on the ‘financial health’ of Indian telecom service provider, BSNL. In her post, she gave misleading figures to allege that BSNL has been “ruined” under the BJP-led NDA government. She also falsely claimed that the national telecom service provider had registered profit when the Congress-led UPA was in power. In the video and text, the Congress spokesperson 
However, the numbers she quoted in her post are grossly incorrect. Contrary to the figures quoted by the Congress functionary, BSNL was not even in profit in 2013. Rather it was in a loss of Rs 14979 crores. झूट बोलो, बार-बार झूट बोलो।@roshnikushal का यही काम है।2013 में BSNL 10183 करोड़ के मुनाफ़े में नहीं, बल्कि 14979 करोड़ घाटे में थी।2023 में BSNL 13356 करोड़ के घाटे में नहीं बल्कि 8161 करोड़ के घाटे में थी।सरकार को संज्ञान लेना चाहिए व कांग्रेसियों पर कार्रवाई करनी चाहिए। https://t.co/qzwJaz3Zng pic.twitter.com/4aqYBsudJDSimilarly, BSNL registered a loss of Rs 8,161 crore in FY2023 and not Rs 13,356 crores as the Congress functionary falsely claimed.The claim that BSNL was profiting in 2013, the last full financial year when the UPA government was in power is “Fake”. It is pertinent to note that BSNL’s profit steeply started declining after 2005 and FY 2009-10 was the first time when BSNL started incurring losses. Incidentally, it was the time when the UPA government was in power and the country, especially, the telecom sector was rocked by one scam after another.  Contrary to the allegations that the Modi-led NDA government caused the ill-health of BSNL, the following snippets from media reports are examples of how the allegations of corruption and scams during the UPA era “ruined” the Telecom sector and dented BSNL’s financial health to such an extent that since 2009-10 when it incurred losses for the first time, it has not earned the profitable territory. It adversely impacted the basic infrastructure of the telecom service provider.UPA-era Ministers who were at the helm of affairs in the telecom sector had faced serious allegations of corruption, while the Former Cabinet Ministers have avoided jail terms in these cases on grounds of lack of evidence, hampered BSNL to a great extent. On the contrary, the Modi government has made multiple efforts to revive the ailing telecom service provider including the announcement of three revival packages for BSNL.The first revival package was announced in October 2019. It was worth Rs 69,000 and it helped stabilise BSNL as it brought down excessive employee expenses and in FY21 BSNL losses were nearly halved. After the second revival package announced in 2022 which was worth Rs 1.64 lakh crore, average revenue per user for BSNL/MTNL started seeing improvements. Post revival plans, the telecom service provider has marked a drop in losses. Post the two revival packages, BSNL started witnessing operating profit from FY 2020-21. Last year in June, the Modi government announced a third revival package worth Rs 89,047 crores for the state telecom provider. It included allotment of 4G/5G spectrum for BSNL through equity infusion. Additionally, the union cabinet increased the authorised capital for BSNL from Rs 1.5 lakh crore to Rs 2.1 lakh crore, allowing it to raise more funds from the market for its growth. As per reports, the BSNL officials in January this year revealed that its income has gone up, and expenses have also been cut down in 2023-24.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"27 July, 2024",‘Don’t know about you but I have self-respect’: Shazia Ilmi blasts Rajdeep Sardesai for defending cameramen who filmed her inappropriately,https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/shazia-ilmi-rajdeep-sardesai-debate-pervert-camerman-misbehaved-controversy/,"Shazia Ilmi had left the primetime debate of Rajdeep Sardesai half-way after he asked to cut off the mic of the BJP spokesperson. Despite this, the cameraman kept filming without her consent.On Friday (26th July), BJP spokesperson Shazia Ilmi came down heavily on Rajdeep Sardesai after the latter accused her of ‘attacking’ the cameraman of the India Today group.Ilmi had left the primetime debate of the ‘propagandist masquerading as journalist’ half-way after he asked to cut off the mic of the BJP spokesperson. Despite this, the cameraman kept filming without her consent, leading to a physical altercation.In a tweet, Shazia Ilmi stated, “Don’t you ever bring down my Fader again. Remember I have been on both the sides and know how to handle bullies like you. BTW it doesn’t behove political propagandists masquerading as journalists to sermonise.”Ma’am, @shaziailmi I respect all my guests always. If anything, I am too indulgent: the fader is lowered only to avoid cross talk and noise on the show. If you have a grouse with me or with an army general on the show, of course that’s your prerogative. And I respect that too.… https://t.co/43atjurw75 pic.twitter.com/VjfmrrGWszRajdeep Sardesai was quick to play the ‘victim card’ and accuse the BJP spokesperson of assaulting the cameraman. “I respect all my guests always. If anything, I am too indulgent: the fader is lowered only to avoid cross talk and noise on the show. If you have a grouse with me or with an army general on the show, of course that’s your prerogative. And I respect that too,” he claimed in a tweet. “But for you to chuck the Mike and abuse our video journalist and throw him out of your house is just NOT done. He was only doing his job. No excuse for bad behaviour. The rest I leave to you. Have a good weekend (the video below is from last night…” he continued.Sardesai had also shared a video of the physical altercation. Shazia Ilmi thanked the propagandist for providing video evidence and called out the ‘pervert’ cameraman for zooming on her chest. “Why on earth would I stay on your show when you humiliate me and say CUT SHAZIA’s Mike off ? Only because I asked you whether you think all the Defence Chiefs are lying. Don’t know about you but I have SELF RESPECT,” she tweeted.@sardesairajdeep@IndiaToday Thanks for providing me with the EVIDENCE which clearly shows how your camera man behaved after the show 1. Why on earth would I stay on your show when you humiliate me and say CUT SHAZIA’s Mike off ? Only because I asked you whether you think all…The BJP spokesperson detailed the problematic behaviour of the cameraman, which forced her to evict him from her house. “Your cameraman watched me struggle as I got up and continued to film me trying to remove my mike, instead of helping me with the wheelchair. Why was he still continuing to focus on MY UPPER BODY showing it up close. It was so uncomfortable for me and I felt most embarrassed,” she pointed out.“Any lady would tell you that focussing on their chest is a clear NO NO. I could see this live on screen and requested him not to film me any or switch off the camera light. The pervert cameraman continued to film me despite my obvious physical and emotional discomfort after the show was over. Why ? Why would he keep filming him in my home, my SAFE place against my WILL? And that too, AFTER the show?” Shazia Ilmi asked.“Just because you’re a famous anchor (just as much you’re a sore loser) doesn’t mean you can humiliate people who call you out and force your crews on people , beyond the brief and violate their private space. And I dare India Today to show footage of my upper body and chest again. I will take this matter up seriously as I was deeply hurt and humiliated by this behaviour,” she warned.@sardesairajdeep @IndiaToday अपनी बदतमीज़ी का प्रमाण देने के लिए शुक्रिया ! मेरा घर मेरी सफ़ेद स्पेस है!!

It’s my house and I’m curious whether your wife would entertain a crew shooting her remove her mike from up close and then follow her around after show. Thanks for providing this VIDEO EVIDENCE, which clearly shows how the lecherous cameraman is continuing to film me despite me not wanting to be ON air.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"23 July, 2024","Innocence exploited – How NewsLaundry lied and defamed Hindu activist Bittu Bajrangi, who spoke to them in good faith",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/newslaundry-lied-defamed-hindu-bittu-bajrangi-spoke-to-them-in-good-faith-nuh-violence/,"While granting bail to Bittu, the court noted, “It has nowhere been pointed out that as to whether these weapons were being used to cause violence on the spot or to inflict any injury either to the policemen or to any people of a particular community. No such allegations are there. Snatching of such articles/weapons from the policemen is also highly improbable.” Bittu Bajrangi was accused under sections 148, 149, 332, 353, 186, 395, 397, 506, 25, 54, and 59 of the IPC in connection with the Nuh violence incident.On Saturday, 20th July, propaganda portal Newslaundry published a video interview with Gaurakshak Bajrang Force chief Bittu Bajrangi. While speaking to Bittu, Newslaundry’s reporter Avdesh Kumar spoke to him politely but the agenda with which he approached the interview was sinister.Violence broke out in Nuh during a jalabhishek yatra in July last year, killing six people. Key accused Bittu Bajrangi is set to lead the same yatra today.Catch the cow vigilante in conversation with @ImAvdheshkumar: https://t.co/Mlmg1HouAB pic.twitter.com/drH6xJ1h93The title of the video interview reads, “The main accused of Nuh riots and out on bail Bittu Bajrangi to organize Jalabhishek Yatra again”. The description of the video, which was in Hindi, read, “Bittu Bajrangi, the main accused in the violence that occurred on July 31 last year, is personally inviting people to participate in this procession. We spoke to Bittu Bajrangi in detail about this matter. It should be noted that the violence in Nuh, Haryana, last year created a climate of concern across the state and the country. This violence occurred during a religious procession when a minor dispute between two communities suddenly escalated. Six people lost their lives, and many were injured in the violence.”The description further read, “Bittu Bajrangi, known as a Gau Rakshak, was prominently implicated in this incident. He also runs an organization called Gau Raksha Bajrang Force. Last year, he was arrested on charges of inciting violence and playing an active role in it. The police and administration considered him one of the main accused. Bittu Bajrangi participated in the religious procession during which the violence started. He is accused of inciting his supporters and encouraging them to engage in violent activities. Immediately after the violence, Bittu Bajrangi was taken into police custody, and multiple charges were filed against him. He is currently out on bail.”OpIndia talked to Bittu Bajrangi to get his views on the title and description. He said, “I am heartbroken. I will be vigilant next time before agreeing to an interview”. From his statement, it is evident that he was unaware of how he was going to be presented in the video.No one is denying that there are several cases filed against Bittu Bajrangi, especially linked to his Gau Raksha work. However, in this case, Newslaundry has presented him as if he was the one solely responsible for the Nuh violence that took place on 31st July 2023. OpIndia accessed court documents, including his bail orders by the Sessions Court. There was no mention that he was the main accused. As the order read, Usha [Kundu], HPS Additional Superintendent of Police, Nuh, was posted on the day of the incident. She noticed Bittu and his accomplices coming towards the temple to join the procession.She pointed out in her complaint that Bittu and his accomplices were carrying swords and Trishul-like weapons which were confiscated by the police. After the police confiscated the swords and Trishul, Bittu and his accomplices got into an altercation with the police and staged a protest by sitting on the road in front of the police vehicle. It was then alleged that they forcefully took the weapons away. Defense counsel appearing for Bittu argued that the alleged weapons were just symbols that were carried for display.  While granting bail to Bittu, the court noted, “It has nowhere been pointed out that as to whether these weapons were being used to cause violence on the spot or to inflict any injury either to the policemen or to any people of a particular community. No such allegations are there. Snatching of such articles/weapons from the policemen is also highly improbable.” Bittu Bajrangi was accused under sections 148, 149, 332, 353, 186, 395, 397, 506, 25, 54, and 59 of the IPC in connection with the Nuh violence incident.It was nowhere mentioned in the FIR that Bittu Bajrangi used the weapons or inflicted any injuries on police personnel or people of a particular community.Notably, a trial in the matter has started in the Sessions court and a non-bailable warrant was issued against Bittu as he failed to appear in court via video conferencing. His counsel argued there was some miscommunication but NBW was issued by the court. However, that still does not prove that he played any role in the violence.Newslaundry’s description lacks facts. They mentioned that six people were killed but did not mention what was the reason behind it. Newslaundry failed to mention that a Hindu boy named Abhishek was shot dead and then beheaded by an Islamist mob. Abhishek’s head was then crushed with a stone. Newslaundry did not make a video explaining how an Islamist mob attacked a cybercrime police station or how a female judge was attacked during the violence by the Islamist mob when she was traveling with her daughter. Shops of Hindus were burnt to the ground, Hindu pilgrims were made hostages in a temple, and police personnel and home guards were killed by the riotous Islamist mob. This is how propaganda works and Newslaundry is an expert in it.As mentioned earlier, no one is denying the cases against Bittu. He mentioned that there are around eight cases currently pending against him and he has been in and out of jail over such cases. But that does not nullify the fact that he has tirelessly worked for the welfare of the Hindu community including Gau Raksha. While propaganda portals do not skip a breath before mentioning terrorists like Afzal Guru as a professor or riot-accused Umar Khalid as a “student activist”, when it comes to Hindu activists like Bittu, they present them as no less than terrorists, while hiding the crimes of the Islamists against which those like Bittu Bajrangi act in defense. Hundreds and thousands of Hindu activists are misrepresented by the left-leaning media which often distorts their intentions and work. Take the example of this interview. The NL reporter kept pressing Bittu to “reveal” his political affiliation. Bittu pointed out that he works independently without any political affiliation or “sar par haath” per se.Kumar kept asking if he was associated with RSS, BJP, or VHP. Bittu clearly said that he is inspired by these organizations and attached to them in one way or another. When the reporter said VHP has “disowned” him, Bittu said, “When a family member does something wrong, the elders of the family say in anger ‘he is not part of our family’. That does not necessarily mean that the person who did wrong has been disowned”. The argument visibly rattled the reporter, and he changed his course of questions.From the use of foul language to alleged derogatory social media posts, Kumar did not leave any stone unturned to agitate Bittu during the interview. Bittu at one point said, “I am a very calm person who does not use foul language. However if someone acts against the Hindu community, I may get angry”. He admitted he gets angry but that does not mean he uses foul language every time he speaks, something which Newslaundry’s reporter wanted to present.What could be the aim of such an interview that too just a couple of days before the scheduled Brijmandal Yatra? The aim was simple. Newslaundry wanted to set a narrative that Bittu Bajrangi was the key accused and reason for Nuh’s violence last year. In case anything happens during the 2024 Yatra, the blame would have again gone to Hindu activists. Unfortunately for Newslaundry and fortunately for Bittu, he was not granted permission to attend Yatra. It was one of his bail conditions that he would not visit Nuh until the trial was over, which could have led to the denial of the permission, this, despite there being no proof of his involvement in any violence during the Nuh Yatra, and there being plenty of evidence of the violence unleashed by the Muslim mob.One can only hope nothing happens during the ongoing Brijmandal Yatra as 5,000 police personnel have been deployed by the Haryana government to avoid any sort of agitation or violence. In a country where Hindus are supposedly a majority, they need protection from the police (in the case of Brijmandal Yatra) and the Army (in the case of Amarnath Yatra) to participate in a pilgrimage which speaks volumes about the reality of the situation.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"18 July, 2024",Media reports highlighting high number of ‘zero dose children’ in India paint an incomplete picture of the country’s immunization efforts: Health Ministry,https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/media-reports-of-india-having-high-number-of-zero-dose-children-depict-incomplete-picture-health-ministry/,"The media reports present a flawed comparison with countries without taking into consideration India’s population and high vaccination coverage, the ministry said in a statementThere have been some media reports stating that, in comparison to other countries, India has a high number of ‘zero dose children’ – children who did not receive any vaccine, according to a recent UNICEF report. These reports depict an incomplete picture of the country’s immunization data, as they do not factor in the population base and immunization coverage of the countries compared, said the Union Health Ministry.The accurate and complete narrative of the immunisation efforts of the government can be gauged through a comprehensive understanding of the relative data and programmatic interventions.In India, for most of the antigens, the coverage is more than 90%, which is on par with other high-income countries, e.g., New Zealand (DTP-1 93%), Germany & Finland (DPT-3 91%), Sweden (MCV-1 93%), Luxembourg (MCV-2 90%), Ireland (PCV-3 83%), United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (RotaC 90%), said the Ministry.Even if the India’s coverage of 83% is compared for Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV), which falls at the lowest bracket, it is much higher than the global figures of 65%.India, with its large population, has the highest number of vaccinated children. The target cohort of India is more than 3 times of the other nine countries compared in the graph. Among the compared countries, India is the only country having DTP-1 (Penta-1) coverage above 90% and dropout children, i.e., those that receive a first but not the third dose of DTP (Penta), are 2%, whereas this gap is much wider in other compared countries. These figures are clearly reflective of focused programmatic interventions in the country within the folds of its wide socio-geographic diversity.The country’s Universal Immunization Programme is the largest public health initiative, targeting a massive cohort of 2.6 crore children and 2.9 crore pregnant women annually through 1.2 crore vaccination sessions. The Full Immunization Coverage for FY 2023-24 stands at 93.23% nationally. With consistent efforts to reach and vaccinate all eligible children against vaccine preventable diseases, the country has been able to achieve a noteworthy reduction in the Under-5 Mortality Rate (U5MR) declining from 45 per 1000 live births in 2014 to 32 per 1000 live births (SRS 2020). In addition, India has widened the basket of vaccines with the introduction of six new vaccines under the UIP to increase breadth of protection since 2014.To reach out to zero dose and under vaccinated children, India has implemented initiatives under Mission Indradhanush and Intensified Mission Indradhanush with the support of the States. This has resulted in the reduction in the number of zero dose children by 34% between 2014-2023. Since 2014, 12 phases of Mission Indradhanush have been conducted across all districts wherein 5.46 crore children and 1.32 crore pregnant women have been vaccinated across all phases.India provides maximum number of WHO recommended vaccines under the UIP in comparison to most of the other countries. The mean coverage for India is 83.4%, which is more than 10 percentage point of the global coverage. With high level of coverage of OPV and IPV, India has successfully maintained 13 years of polio-free status since the last polio case was detected in 2011.With 93% DTP-1 (Penta-1) vaccine 1st dose coverage and 93% Measles and Rubella vaccine 1st dose coverage, the drive in the country is to reduce zero-dose children and achieving Measles and Rubella elimination. In recognition of its tireless efforts to combat Measles and Rubella, India was bestowed with the prestigious Measles and Rubella Champion Award by The Measles and Rubella Partnership (American Red Cross, BMGF, GAVI, US CDC, UNF, UNICEF, and WHO) at the American Red Cross Headquarters in Washington DC, USA on March 6th, 2024, the Ministry said.(This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

"16 July, 2024","Victim blaming, intellectual dishonesty and complete lack of empathy: ‘The Hindu’ follows global Left in downplaying assassination attempt on Donald Trump",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/the-hindu-donald-trump-assassination-attempt-whitewashing-democrats-leftist-media-editorial-problems-explained/,"Though a late entrant in this game of whitewashing, The Hindu made it clear that it will not fall far behind its global counterparts in peddling agenda in the name of news editorial.Three days after an assassination attempt was carried out on Donald Trump during an election rally in Pennsylvania, ‘The Hindu’ newspaper on Tuesday (16th July) blamed the former US President for the tragedy that befell him.In a disturbing editorial titled ‘Dodging bullets: On an assassination bid and U.S. politics’, the Indian daily suggested that the attack on Donald Trump was somehow due to his own political rhetorics.‘The Hindu‘ alleged that the former US President supposedly condoned and sympathised with the use of violence in the political sphere. To substantiate its claims, the leftist newspaper cited the example of the 2021 Capitol Hill siege by Trump supporters. “Ironically, the attack comes after months of Mr. Trump and his supporters periodically indulging in rhetoric that condoned or sympathised with violence or violent intentions in the political sphere,”  it claimed.‘The Hindu’ shrewdly invoked a 3-year-old incident to lay the foundation for its vicious claim that Donald Trump was somehow responsible for the assassination attempt, which took one life and injured three others including the ex-US President.The leftist newspaper also ensured that the incumbent US President Joe Biden is projected in a positive light. As part of this narrative-building exercise, ‘The Hindu’ emphasised Biden’ promptness in condemning the attack that nearly claimed the life of Donald Trump.Thanks to its lack of objective reporting, the Indian daily ignored mentioning how Joe Biden and Democrats had been dog-whistling against Donald Trump for a long. The Hindu chose to highlights the 3-year-old Capitol Hill siege but not the recent provocative tweet by Joe Biden.In June this year, the incumbent US President dubbed Donald Trump as a ‘threat to freedom and democracy.’ Joe Biden even went on to label Trump as antithesis to American values. Even a day before the assassination attempt, the incumbent US President continued his diatribe against Donald Trump. However, none of these remarks constituted as ‘violent or inciteful’ political rhetoric to ‘The Hindu’ Editor. ""Most importantly, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, Trump is a threat to this nation."" – Joe Biden yesterday pic.twitter.com/31lNO7bk3pThe editorial by the Indian newspaper read, “President Joe Biden unequivocally and immediately condemned the attack on Mr. Trump, saying that there was no place in America for this. “We must unite as one nation to condemn it. It’s sick.” Similar sentiments were expressed by other political figures.”Not just Joe Biden, prominent Democrats and their loyalists in the media had time and again used violent language to rebuke Donald Trump and rally Americans against him.Thanks to the ‘left-liberal’ privilege, these provocateurs are not held responsible for their vile rhetorics and complete lack of civility. Instead, all attempts are made to silence those who dare to question them.Every single one of these Democrats should be impeached/jailed for inciting the assassination attempt of Donald Trump.It's time for us to use their own January 6th logic against them… pic.twitter.com/o8yNv4bDkXAs expected, ‘The Hindu’ did its best to shield Democrats from criticism. The Indian daily went on to imply that pointing out the dangerous discourse of Joe Biden and his party members in the run-up to the assassination attempt was somehow “vicious commentary” and false equivalence.“The more complex and troubling question is the extent to which the Trump campaign, in its bid to capitalise on the near martyrdom of its candidate, will adopt the language of hate politics, building on vicious comments that have already been circulating on social media since the attack, many of them blaming Democrats for the violence and deliberately conflating political opposition with personal animus,” the newspaper attempted to give a clean chit to the real provocateurs.Another concerning element of the editorial is also its defeating lack of empathy. The fact that the assassination claimed the life of an innocent spectator, critically injured two others and almost killed Donald Trump has little to no mention.He is only mentioned in the context of elections, polarisation in the political discourse and the possible outcome of the 2024 Presidential race. This becomes evident from the following excerpts of the editorial –In its desperate attempt to villainise Donald Trump, ‘The Hindu’ failed to showcase empathy for the primary subject of its editorial piece who braved the assassination ploy with his indomitable spirit to “fight.”The Left ecosystem, particularly in the US, had left no stone unturned to downplay the assassination attempt on Donald Trump. We have seen everything from labelling the attack as ‘staged’ to suggesting that nothing of any significance had occurred.OpIndia had reported in detail how legacy media houses such as the Associate Press, CNN, ABC News, USA Today, MSNBC and The Washington Post wrote outrageous headlines to pass off gunfire as ‘loud noise.’Though a late entrant in this game of whitewashing, The Hindu made it clear that it will not fall far behind its global counterparts in peddling agenda in the name of news editorial.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"16 July, 2024","‘Loud’, ‘popping’ noises – US media downplays assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, 20-year-old shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks shot dead",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/us-media-downplayed-assassination-attempt-on-donald-trump/,"The Associated Press's first Wire release read, ""Donald Trump whisked off stage in Pennsylvania after loud noises rang through the crowd"". The Wire Report by the Associated Press was picked up by many media houses with similar headlines. On 13th July (local time), an assassination attempt on former United States President Donald Trump shook the world. Though Trump is safe, a bullet pierced his ear leading to blood flowing on his face. Photographs and videos of the incident went viral on social media. The incident took place at Trump’s rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. He was immediately escorted off stage by US Secret Service agents and taken away in a motorcade. While the world leaders condemned the assassination attempt, US media tried to downplay the incident.The Associated Press’s first Wire release read, “Donald Trump whisked off stage in Pennsylvania after loud noises rang through the crowd”. The report by the Associated Press was picked up by many media houses with similar headlines.ABC News report, which was based on Associated Press’s wire, read, “Donald Trump escorted off stage by Secret Service during rally after loud noises ring out in crowd”.USA Today’s headline read, “Trump removed from stage by Secret Service after loud noises startles former president, crowd”.MSNBC report’s headline read, “Trump rushed offstage at Pennsylvania rally by Secret Service after loud popping noises heard”. Now-changed, the Washington Post’s headline read, “Trump escorted away after loud noises at Pa. rally”.Washington Post’s post on X read, “Breaking news: Former president Donald Trump was just rushed offstage after loud noises were reported at rally in Pennsylvania.”While media houses downplayed the assassination attempt, several journalists and X users on social media platforms expressed dismay that Trump was alive. A screenshot was shared by Libs of TikTok on X where The Stranger’s journalist Ashley Nerbovig wrote, “Make America aim again”. Ashley later locked and then deactivated her account.This is a journalist for Seattle based news site @TheStranger pic.twitter.com/pkr3veJLrqLibs Of Tiktok also shared two videos of leftist screaming over the assassin missing the “target”. Tiktok user Cele2t3 screamed her lungs out while crying over the missed assassination. Her TikTok account has either been deleted or deactivated. This unhinged leftist is having a meltdown because the sh**ter missed Trump. These people are deranged. pic.twitter.com/7UGmq2vNw6Another TikTok user Super99x expressed similar behaviour. His account has been turned to “private” on TikTok. Leftist cries actual tears because the sh**ter missed Trump. pic.twitter.com/7hxEXuNbVcThe bullet fired at Donald Trump pierced the upper part of his right ear. Trump was immediately escorted off stage by US Secret Service agents and taken to a hospital. In a statement, the US Secret Service said that a suspected shooter fired multiple shots towards the stage from an elevated position outside of the rally venue during Trump’s campaign rally in Butler on July 13 at 6:15 pm.The attacker has been identified as Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. He was neutralised by security forces after he fired multiple shots from an AR-15-type semiautomatic rifle. One person in the rally died in the incident, and two others were seriously injured. Former President Trump is definitely an eye sour for the left-liberals of the US. There have been countless attempts including shutting his social media accounts to supress his voice. The elections are scheduled in the US in coming months and such attempts are only going to make his support base stronger, something that Trump haters yet to understand.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

The decision was taken during the ongoing 46th session of the World Heritage Committee (WHC), held in the national capital, Delhi.UNESCO will examine the proposals of 27 sites for inscription on the World Heritage List, the state of conservation of 124 sites already inscribed on the World Heritage List, and the List of World Heritage in Danger. The World Heritage Committee is one of the two bodies governing the Convention for the Protection of the World’s Cultural and Natural Heritage. It is composed of the representatives of 21 states, elected from the 195 states parties to the Convention.In the ongoing session, from July 23 to July 25, the Committee will examine the state of conservation of the 124 sites already inscribed on the World Heritage List, 57 of which are also on the List of World Heritage in Danger. Similarly, from July 26 to July 29, the Committee will examine the dossiers of 27 sites proposed for inscription on the World Heritage List. The sites will be examined according to three categories. The three categories are natural, mixed, and cultural.Reacting to the news Assam Chief Minister Himmant Biswa Sharma said, “The Moidams make it to the UNESCO World Heritage list under the category Cultural Property.

Over mere apprehension that certain Islamic heritage sites in Saudi Arabia would encourage idol-worship, the Saudi government and Wahabis in the past have razed them and modified their usage.Before delving into how historic structures have over the years been destroyed to prevent the promotion of ‘idol worship’, it is pertinent to learn about who the Wahabis are and about the House of Saud.The Wahhabis are the most conservative sect of Sunni Islam. This fundamentalist branch of Islam called Wahabism was founded by Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahab in the 18th century. Wahabis strive to ‘return’ to the “pure” form of Islam as practised and propagated by Prophet Muhammad. Wahhabism emphasizes stringent monotheism and vehemently opposes practices like idol worship as it is shirk [sin], including the veneration of saints/sufis and the use of religious relics etc.Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahab had sought refuge in Diriyah, a small oasis town on the outskirts of modern-day Riyadh. Diriyah was ruled by its Chieftain Muhammad ibn Saud from the Al Saud. Saud not only gave refuge to Wahab after he was thrown out of Hejaz, the region that housed both Mecca and Medina but also signed a pact with him in 1744. This “Wahhabi-Saudi Pact” marked the beginning of the First Saudi state wherein Muhammad ibn Saud became the Emir while Wahab assumed the title of “Imam”.To solidify the accord, Ibn Saud’s eldest son married al-Wahhab’s daughter and Al Saud publicly accepted Wahhabism. Wahab’s puritanical form of Islam passionately opposed religious innovation (bidaa) and pushed for the abolition of traditions such as Sufi ceremonies and saint veneration. During their conquest outside of Najd, they demolished several Shia shrines. The Wahabis employed the insult ‘Rafida’ (rejecters) to classify Shia, a practice that persists into the twenty-first century.The radical ideology of Wahhabism has resulted in the systematic destruction of several Saudi heritage monuments. Wahhabis believed conserving these places would give rise to idol worship, which is forbidden under their understanding of Islam. Thus, many historical and religious structures have been razed to prohibit any form of worship or pilgrimage that contradicts their rigid monotheistic perspectives.In the year 1802, Wahhabi forces led by Saud bin Abdul-Aziz attacked the city of Karbala which came under the Ottoman Empire’s rule. Karbala to this day remains a holy site for Shias. During the Diriyah campaign, Abdul-Aziz-led forces destroyed the tomb of Husayn ibn Ali killed thousands of Shia inhabitants and plundered the city. The Wahabis carried out this massacre of over two to five thousand Shias right ahead of the month of Muharram.Although Karbala is in modern-day Iraq, the Wahabi-Saudi attack on this Shia-revered site gives an insight into the fanatic mindset of the Wahabis. The Wahabis deem rituals such as intercession [shafa’ah] which means pleading to Allah through a Muslim saint, erecting structures over graves, pilgrimages (ziyarah), and tawassul [means that can be used to gain nearness to Allah]to be signs of shirk [polytheism/idolatry] and strongly oppose them.By 1806, the Wahabis captured the city of Medina and unleashed massive destruction of structures they feared would promote idolatry. The Wahabi forces razed all domes and structures within, and outside, of the Jannat-al Baqi cemetery. This was no ordinary cemetery but the first Islamic cemetery in Medina in Hejaz. They also destroyed the Mosque of Fatima al-Zahra, the Mosque of al-Manaratain, and Qubbat’ al-Thanaya among other structures of Islamic significance.After the death of Tusun Pasha, the son of Egypt’s Wali Muhammad Ali Pasha who led Ottoman forces against the Emir of Diriyah, Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Saud in 1816, in 1818, the Ottoman caliphate led by Sultan Mahmoud II decided to crush the Wahabis. In this vein, Tusun Pasha’s son Ibrahim Pasha led his forces to Diriyah, inflicting a crushing defeat on the Wahabis and reclaiming Mecca and Medina. With this, the first Saud state rule came to an end. After this, the Ottomans grandly renovated the mosques. They also constructed a dome on the vandalised Baqi’ cemetery over the graves of the Prophet Muhammad’s daughter Fatima al-Zahra, Zainul ‘Abidin (‘Ali bin al-Hussain), Muhammad ibn ‘Ali al-Baqir and Ja’far al-Sadiq.The architectural grandeur, however, did not last long as in 1924, the House of Saud regained control of the two Islamic holy cities—Mecca and Medina. The Wahabi Sauds undertook a second campaign against the Jannat ul Baqi cemetery and unleashed the destruction of graves, mosques, domes and other structures. With the permission of King Ibn Saud on 25 April 1925, Mausoleums, domes, and gravestones were destroyed by the Wahabi forces. The graves destroyed here included those of Prophet Muhammad’s mother Aminah, father Abdullah ibn Abdul-Muttalib and other family members in addition to prominent Imams.To this day, the Wahabi clerics justify the destruction of many such heritage sites saying that structures dedicated to the mortal beings diluted the worship of a single and unique Allah.Notably, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has undertaken four major expansion projects to accommodate more pilgrims arriving at the Grand Mosque. King Abdulaziz initiated the first such project in 1955 involving the construction of new floors, courtyards, and the installation of electric lights and fans., the second was launched by King Fahd in 1988 for adding new wings on the eastern and western sides, the construction of minarets, and the installation of escalators and air conditioning systems and other facilities.In 2008, the Saudi government, led by King Abdullah Ibn Abdulaziz, approved the Grand Mosque’s expansion, which included the expropriation of 3,200,000 sq ft of land to the north and northwest of it. In 2011, King Abdullah’s government announced that under the “King Abdullah Expansion Project” worth $21 billion several new structures including minarets would be erected and the circumambulation (Mataf) area would be expanded to accommodate 2.5 million Haj pilgrims. Since then, numerous heritage sites have been demolished in the two holy cities.Among the notable structures destroyed included the Ottoman portico, which was a significant architectural feature. This structure dates back to the 17th century and was renowned for its distinctive arches and columns. The destruction of the Ottoman portico sparked strong outrage in Turkey in 2013. Besides, Abbasid-era columns, also integral to the historical architecture of the mosque, were destroyed during the expansion.Reports say that since 1985, 98% of the historical and Islamic heritage sites have been demolished with critics alleging that the Saudi government wants to “wipe out” history. A notable such site included the house of Hamza, the Prophet Muhammad’s uncle. This house was destroyed to make way for a hotel.Similarly, the house of Prophet Muhammad’s wife Khadijah was demolished and 1400 public toilets were built at the site nearly a decade back. This is also confirmed by British historian Ziauddin Sardar in his book Mecca: The Sacred City.“The complex stands on top of the bulldozed al-Ayad fort, built in 1781 and no longer able to perform its function of protecting Mecca from invaders. At the opposite end of the Grand Mosque Complex, as it is now called, the house of Khadijah, the first wife of the Prophet Muhammad, has been turned into a block of toilets.2 The Royal Makkah Clock Tower is not the only building to hover above the Sacred Mosque. There is the Raffles Makkah Palace, a luxury hotel, with round-the-clock butler service. Add to that the Makkah Hilton, built over the house of Abu Bakr, the closest companion of the Prophet and the first caliph. Along with the Intercontinental Mecca, they all vie for prominence on the skyline. There are numerous other five-star hotels and high-rise apartment blocks,” Sardar wrote. He further added, “Within the next decade, there will be a ring of 130 skyscrapers looking down upon the Sacred Mosque. There are spectacular plans to further redevelop the Sacred Mosque so that it can accommodate up to 5 million worshippers. With a seemingly casual disregard for history, the Saudis are rebuilding the Ottoman-era section of the Haram, the oldest surviving section of the Sacred Mosque. The interior, of exquisite beauty, with intricately carved marble columns, built by a succession of Ottoman sultans – Sultan Suleiman, Sultan Salim I, Sultan Murad III, and Sultan Murad IV from 1553 to 1629, will give way to a series of multi-storey prayer halls, eighty metres high.”“The columns, which are adorned with calligraphy of the names of the Prophet’s companions, will be demolished. Indeed, the whole of the old Sacred Mosque will be bulldozed. History stretches back to Umar, the second caliph of Islam, ibn Zubair, who sacrificed his life to rebuild the Kaaba, and to the Abbasid caliphs, who will be replaced by an ultra-modern doughnut-shaped building. The new Jamarat Bridge will ultimately be twelve storeys high, so pilgrims will be able to ‘Stone the Devils’ on even more multiple levels. It seems only a matter of time before the house where Prophet Muhammad was born, located opposite the imposing Royal Palace, is razed to the ground, and turned, probably, into a car park,” Sardar wrote.On the 13th of August 2002, the 1,200-year-old mosque and tomb of Sayyid Imam al-Uraidhi ibn Ja’far al-Sadiq, the ninth in the line of Prophet Muhammad, located four kilometres from Masjid-e Nabawi in Medina, was destroyed by explosives and levelled.In 2003, a historic Ottoman Ajyad Fortress that once protected Mecca from attack and dated back over 200 years was demolished, only to be rebuilt by a massive 601-meter Mecca Royal Hotel Clock Tower. This clocktower is part of a complex built by the Bin Laden Group including five-storey shopping malls, luxury hotels, parking etc.At that time, Turkey had sought UNESCO’s intervention to stop the Fortress’s destruction, however, UNESCO did not intervene.Besides, several mountains have also been destroyed in the holy city to construct roads. In 2013,  the split in Mount Uhud, north of Medina was filled with concrete. Reports say that Prophet Muhammad was carried there after being wounded in the Battle of Uhud against the Quraysh in 625 AD.In addition to this, the famous Hilton Hotel was built over the site where once the house of Abu Bakr, the first caliph, stood.Dr Irfan al-Alawi, historian, founder and former executive director of the Islamic Heritage Research Foundation estimated that over 300 Islamic heritage sites have been demolished over the years as a part of the expansion projects.“Six small mosques in Medina where Muhammad is believed to have prayed have been locked. The seventh, belonging to Islam’s first caliph Abu Bakr, has been razed to make way for an ATM,” a TIME Magazine report from 2014 reads.Of the famed “Seven Mosques” originally established by Prophet Muhammad’s daughter and four of his “greatest Companions” five have been demolished namely: Masjid Abu Bakr, Masjid Salman al-Farsi, Masjid Umar ibn al-Khattab, Masjid Sayyida Fatima bint Rasulillah, and Masjid Ali ibn Abi Talib.Interestingly, over 75 years ago, the birthplace of Prophet Muhammad was reportedly turned into a “cattle market” near Ka’ba. At present, his birthplace located at Suq al-Layl Street has been turned into a library named Makkah Al Mukarramah Library by the Saudi government.There are six UNESCO heritage sites in Saudi Arabia: The Gateway to Mecca and Medina, At-Turaif District in Diriyah, Rock Art of the Hail Region, Al-Hijr Archaeological Site (Madain Salih), Al Ahsa Oasis and Hima Cultural Area. While the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization has been advocating for the preservation of heritage sites across the world, it has failed to advocate for the preservation of sites of cultural and religious significance.Back in March 2001, Afghanistan’s Taliban government demolished the Bamiyan Buddhas, two enormous statues carved into the cliffs of the Bamiyan Valley in the sixth century. Mullah Mohammed Omar, the Taliban leader, ordered the destruction, declaring the monuments blasphemous and against Islamic principles since idols and statues are considered haram by the Taliban as well who are Sunni Muslims of the Deobandi (Hanafi) sect. Ignoring international outrage and condemnation, the Taliban destroyed the ancient statues, which were regarded as Buddhist treasures and part of Afghanistan’s cultural heritage.The destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas by the Taliban is closely aligned with Wahabi (Salafi) extremist ideology, which advocates a strict and puritanical form of Islam. The Taliban’s demolition of the Bamiyan Buddhas was a manifestation of this extremist ideology, echoing Wahhabi practices of destroying historical and religious monuments of non-Muslims as well as those of Islamic significance since they do not attach much importance to structures dedicated to mortals. The Sauds historically have not been much interested in preserving the Islamic heritage sites since they believe such sites could promote idol worship or Shirk, Indian Sufis had in May this year urged the Saudi Arabian government to rebuild the destroyed Jannat al-Baqi cemetery in Medina. A meeting in this regard was held in Ajmer’s Moinuddin Chishti’s shrine. Unsurprisingly, however, the Saudi government did not respond to their appeal.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"22 July, 2024",The story of Bhagat Singh Thind: A Sikh immigrant who claimed to be ‘White’ and sought citizenship in the USA,https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/bhagat-singh-thind-a-sikh-immigrant-who-claimed-to-be-white-and-sought-citizenship-in-the-usa/,"In 1923, the Supreme Court ruled against him. The court classified him as Caucasian but not considered him “White” by the common man’s understanding of the term.Bhagat Singh Thind was born in 1892 in Amritsar, Punjab, India. He was raised in a devout Sikh family. Before shifting to the USA in 1913, Thind pursued his education at Khalsa College. When he was 20 years old, he moved to Seattle, Washington. Later, he moved to Oregon and worked at a lumber mill in Astoria. Oregon was famous for being a hub of Indian immigrants and a lot of them were associated with the Ghadar Party, a revolutionary group aiming to kick out Britishers from India. [PDF]#TIL Bhagat Singh Thind, a Sikh immigrant, tried to claim citizenship to the USA arguing that he was Aryan and therefore, of the White Race.😂😂😂😂😂 pic.twitter.com/6iiGPO1RewDuring his time in Oregon, it is believed that he was associated with Ghadar Party activists and supported the cause of kicking out Britishers from India. However, during World War I, while the Ghadar Party made a call to all Indians to join forces against the Britishers, Thind decided to choose a different path. He got himself enlisted in the US Army. He was among the first turbaned Sikhs to serve in the American military. Due to his loyalty to the US, he was granted honorary citizenship, a promise made by the US Government to the immigrant soldiers. However, later his citizenship was revoked. Thind decided to legally fight for citizenship.In 1920, his case reached the US Supreme Court. Thind claimed to be “White” to gain citizenship contending he was a Caucasian belonging to the Aryan race. The crux of the case was whether Thind, who belonged to a high caste in India, could be considered “White” under the naturalization laws of the US. In 1923, the Supreme Court ruled against him. The court classified him as Caucasian but not considered him “White” by the common man’s understanding of the term. The decision led to other Asian immigrants losing their citizenship.In the case of United States vs Bhagat Singh Thind, the Supreme Court faced a complex issue. The court had to decide if a High-caste Hindu of full Indian blood, could be considered a “White person” under the Naturalization Act of 1790 or not. Notably, the court’s ruling in Thind’s case contradicted the earlier decision in Ozawa vs United States where a Japanese man was denied citizenship on racial grounds. The court accepted Thind was Caucasian but refused to classify him as a “White person” based on the common understanding of the time and not on “scientific” classification. The court also noted that the Aryan Theory was anyway dismissed by several scholars if not all.Justice Sutherland, who delivered the judgment, emphasised that the words “free white persons” were meant to include only those whom the original framers of the law knew as white, basically immigrants from the British Isles and Northwestern Europe. The racial diversity of more recent immigrants, including those from Eastern, Southern, and Middle Europe, was acknowledged, but people of primarily Asiatic stock, including Hindus, were not considered part of this group.Thind continued his fight for citizenship and later achieved it in 1936 under the Nye-Lea Act which granted citizenship to WWI veterans. Later, the doors to the US were opened for other immigrants as well.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

"24 July, 2024","Muslims open up about how women go missing in Mecca: Kidnapped, groped, and abused, how crimes against women during Hajj go largely unnoticed",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/muslims-women-go-missing-in-mecca-kidnapped-groped-crimes-against-women-during-hajj/,"Not only men, but women have also been reportedly involved in kidnappings. In 2022, a Pakistani woman was arrested for kidnapping a 5-year-old Burmese national girl in Mecca. She was abducted on 29th October and recovered on 1st November.On 21st July, an X user Shadab (ImShadab_) shared disturbing information on the platform that the wife of a known person was abducted by a cab driver during Hajj. Despite the efforts of the police, the wife could not be traced and the husband had to return alone. Screenshots of the now-deleted posts were shared on X by HPhobiaWatch.Wtf is happening in Mecca & Medina??? pic.twitter.com/Q53UbJ1G1AReplying to Shadab, who has now locked his profile after the post went viral, an X user Sadique said a similar incident happened to a girl who was kidnapped by a cab driver. After keeping her allegedly for several days, he left her at the same hotel where she was staying. Later the girl committed suicide. He alleged that girl was raped.Another X user Bajify said a similar incident happened to his neighbour last year. The newlywed couple went to Madina for a pilgrimage. When the husband got out of the cab, the driver ran away with the bride.Another user Mohammed Junaid Khan wrote, “I remember the driver taking us from Makkah to Madinah was throwing phone numbers at all the women. The whole way he was harassing. A similar incident happened. The husband got down to buy water, the driver fled away taking the wife. She was never found.”Women going missing during Hajj is not an uncommon occurrence. OpIndia found several news reports of women gone missing, kidnapped, raped, groped and so on. On 30th October 2023, a report by 964media alleged that a woman from Kalar in the southern Sulaymaniyah governorate went missing in Saudi Arabia where she was performing Umrah. The 59-year-old woman’s family said she travelled with her brother and several other relatives.Her brother said, “We entered the Grand Mosque at precisely 9:24 AM last Friday, and before starting to circle the Kaaba, we hired someone to help her circle it in her wheelchair. We specified a location for him to return her to us upon completion, but he did not come back. We do not want to assume that he might have abducted her. In addition to alerting the security forces, we searched for her in hospitals and with the forensic medicine department but did not find any leads. That’s why we have shared our contact information and requested assistance in finding her.”In 2018, CNN published a detailed report on stories of five women who faced sexual abuse at the Hajj. The report suggested that the most of sexual abuse and harassment incidents were reported to have happened during the tawaf ritual where the pilgrims do a counter-clockwise procession around the Kaaba shrine. Some of the women who talked to CNN reported the incident to the police but claimed that the police ignored their plea.The first story was of a Pakistani woman named Asra Nadeem living in the US who went on pilgrimage at the age of 21 in 2006. After she got stuck in the 2006 stampede, she went again to Mecca to perform Umrah. During that time, she was alone. While performing tawaf, someone grabbed her bum. Later, someone grabbed her breast. When she turned to look who was there, the man smirked at her while he continued to grab her breast.Another story was of an anonymous British woman who was sexually assaulted in Mecca in 2007. Then-32-year-old woman’s breasts and arms were grabbed while performing tawaf. As the procession continued, she felt someone rubbing his erection on her. When she tried to inform the police, she was shooed away. Moments later, someone pushed his hand between her buttocks. She cried and turned only to see a man smiling at him who said, “Alhamdulillah” (Praise to God).The third story was of a woman from Indonesia who faced harassment in 2011. At that time, she was only 17. When she was at the hotel, she was catcalled. At Kabba, during tawaf, she felt someone pushing erected genitalia against her. She never went back for pilgrimage after that.The fourth story was of an anonymous woman from Egypt who faced harassment when she was only 13 years old. When she was returning to the hotel after Umrah, a shopkeeper catcalled her. The second time, during Hajj, someone grabbed her breast. When she looked back, the man who grabbed her breast was standing there with his wife. At that time, she was only 17.The last story was of Anooshe Mushtaq, a Pakistani woman from Australia. When she was 10 years old, she went for Hajj with her family. A young man groped the little child from behind. On the bus, the conductor groped her upper leg and moved his hand on her chest. As mentioned before, she was only 10 years old at that time.In September 2022, Desert Sun reported that a 42-year-old woman was kidnapped in Mecca. She was choked and held for eight hours. The man who kidnapped her was arrested and identified as 39-year-old Daniel Gamez Zaragoza.Not only men, but women have also been reportedly involved in kidnappings. In 2022, a Pakistani woman was arrested for kidnapping a 5-year-old Burmese national girl in Mecca. She was abducted on 29th October and recovered on 1st November.In 2010, it was reported that an Indian-origin girl identified as Mariam was kidnapped from Mecca. This was the first time she was visiting Mecca. Her father said, “We have been here every year for Umrah. She is in the custody of some evil people who are not allowing her to contact us.” The family has been living in Saudi Arabia for 17 years. She went missing after her mother gave her one-riyal bills to distribute among beggers after the pilgrimage. At that time, Mariam was in class 9.These reports are just tip of the iceberg. There are dozens of horrifying incidents crimes against women during Hajj.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

It seems only a matter of time before the house where Prophet Muhammad was born, located opposite the imposing Royal Palace, is razed to the ground, and turned, probably, into a car park,” Sardar wrote.On the 13th of August 2002, the 1,200-year-old mosque and tomb of Sayyid Imam al-Uraidhi ibn Ja’far al-Sadiq, the ninth in the line of Prophet Muhammad, located four kilometres from Masjid-e Nabawi in Medina, was destroyed by explosives and levelled.In 2003, a historic Ottoman Ajyad Fortress that once protected Mecca from attack and dated back over 200 years was demolished, only to be rebuilt by a massive 601-meter Mecca Royal Hotel Clock Tower. This clocktower is part of a complex built by the Bin Laden Group including five-storey shopping malls, luxury hotels, parking etc.At that time, Turkey had sought UNESCO’s intervention to stop the Fortress’s destruction, however, UNESCO did not intervene.Besides, several mountains have also been destroyed in the holy city to construct roads. In 2013,  the split in Mount Uhud, north of Medina was filled with concrete. Reports say that Prophet Muhammad was carried there after being wounded in the Battle of Uhud against the Quraysh in 625 AD.In addition to this, the famous Hilton Hotel was built over the site where once the house of Abu Bakr, the first caliph, stood.Dr Irfan al-Alawi, historian, founder and former executive director of the Islamic Heritage Research Foundation estimated that over 300 Islamic heritage sites have been demolished over the years as a part of the expansion projects.“Six small mosques in Medina where Muhammad is believed to have prayed have been locked. The seventh, belonging to Islam’s first caliph Abu Bakr, has been razed to make way for an ATM,” a TIME Magazine report from 2014 reads.Of the famed “Seven Mosques” originally established by Prophet Muhammad’s daughter and four of his “greatest Companions” five have been demolished namely: Masjid Abu Bakr, Masjid Salman al-Farsi, Masjid Umar ibn al-Khattab, Masjid Sayyida Fatima bint Rasulillah, and Masjid Ali ibn Abi Talib.Interestingly, over 75 years ago, the birthplace of Prophet Muhammad was reportedly turned into a “cattle market” near Ka’ba. At present, his birthplace located at Suq al-Layl Street has been turned into a library named Makkah Al Mukarramah Library by the Saudi government.There are six UNESCO heritage sites in Saudi Arabia: The Gateway to Mecca and Medina, At-Turaif District in Diriyah, Rock Art of the Hail Region, Al-Hijr Archaeological Site (Madain Salih), Al Ahsa Oasis and Hima Cultural Area. While the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization has been advocating for the preservation of heritage sites across the world, it has failed to advocate for the preservation of sites of cultural and religious significance.Back in March 2001, Afghanistan’s Taliban government demolished the Bamiyan Buddhas, two enormous statues carved into the cliffs of the Bamiyan Valley in the sixth century. Mullah Mohammed Omar, the Taliban leader, ordered the destruction, declaring the monuments blasphemous and against Islamic principles since idols and statues are considered haram by the Taliban as well who are Sunni Muslims of the Deobandi (Hanafi) sect. Ignoring international outrage and condemnation, the Taliban destroyed the ancient statues, which were regarded as Buddhist treasures and part of Afghanistan’s cultural heritage.The destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas by the Taliban is closely aligned with Wahabi (Salafi) extremist ideology, which advocates a strict and puritanical form of Islam. The Taliban’s demolition of the Bamiyan Buddhas was a manifestation of this extremist ideology, echoing Wahhabi practices of destroying historical and religious monuments of non-Muslims as well as those of Islamic significance since they do not attach much importance to structures dedicated to mortals. The Sauds historically have not been much interested in preserving the Islamic heritage sites since they believe such sites could promote idol worship or Shirk, Indian Sufis had in May this year urged the Saudi Arabian government to rebuild the destroyed Jannat al-Baqi cemetery in Medina. A meeting in this regard was held in Ajmer’s Moinuddin Chishti’s shrine. Unsurprisingly, however, the Saudi government did not respond to their appeal.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"19 July, 2024","Remember cries of ‘mob lynching by Gau Rakshaks’ in Chhattisgarh? SIT says Saddam, Chand Miya and Guddu jumped to their death, no evidence of...",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/no-lynching-gau-rakshak-saddam-chand-miya-guddu-jumped-death-chhattisgarh-police-sit-chargesheet/,"Initially, the incident was labelled a mob lynching. Afterwards, an SIT was formed to look into the matter and it filed a charge sheet in the court after concluding the investigation. Notably, the police personnel and the charge sheet disclosed that the Muslim men were never attacked. They leapt into the river out of fear and met their deaths.According to the chargesheet presented to the court last week, a Special Investigation Team stated that the three men who were discovered under a bridge in Arang, in the Raipur region of Chhattisgarh last month, “jumped” to their deaths and were neither lynched nor beaten. The deceased were identified as Saddam Qureshi (23) and his cousin Chand Miya Khan (23) who were from Saharanpur district and Guddu Khan (35) of Shamli district. The postmortem report revealed that their death was caused by their fall onto the rocks.The chargesheet was submitted on 8th July but remained confidential until 17th July, when its single page appeared on social media. A previous First Information Report from the police included charges of assault and attempted murder. A Special Investigation Team (SIT) charged five men Harsh Mishra, Mayank Sharma, Raja Agarwal, Navin Thakur and Tanay Luniya under the counts of culpable homicide and common intention for the killings.On 7th June, the three males were reportedly being pursued by the gau-rakshaks (cow-protectors) on suspicion of smuggling cows when they were taking cattle from Chhattisgarh’s Mahasamund to the state capital Raipur. They were subsequently discovered lying on the rocks beneath a bridge. Chand Miya Khan lost his life immediately while Guddu Khan passed away on the way to the hospital that day and Saddam Qureshi died on 18th June from his wounds. Initially, the incident was labelled a mob lynching. Afterwards, an SIT was formed to look into the matter and it filed a charge sheet in the court after concluding the investigation. Notably, the police personnel and the charge sheet disclosed that the Muslim men were never attacked. They leapt into the river out of fear and met their deaths.The gau rakshaks were waiting for the trio in a car as they had information about cattle smuggling, according to the SIT charge sheet. The gau rakshaks tried to halt the four-wheeler and carry out an inspection but the latter drove away to escape for at least 54 kilometres as a long chase ensued. The Muslim men then got off their truck on the Mahanadi bridge located in Arang and plunged into the river believing that there would be water but it was dry and they ended up losing their lives. According to sources, the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) could not establish assault.The authorities earlier lodged a case under Indian Penal Code sections 304 (culpable homicide) and 307 (attempt to murder). Nevertheless, the police removed the attempted murder charge after Saddam Qureshi died because his autopsy report had no mention of assault-related injuries. “The assault never took place. The three got scared and jumped,” confirmed Additional Superintendent (Raipur Rural) Kirtan Rathore when questioned about the chargesheet on 17th July.The Islamists and its ecosystem, whose primary goal is to provide a communal element where none previously existed and blame Hindus didn’t take much time to resort to their devious tricks in this case either. The members of the Muslim community flocked to the streets in Chhattisgarh to demonstrate against the ‘mob lynching’ as their religious and ideological brethren amplified the same lie online. Social media commentator Harun Khan tweeted a video of a protest in Raipur against the alleged murders of the three Muslim men.Chhattisgarh: Large protest in Raipur against mob lynching, People from Muslim community took to the streets. pic.twitter.com/fbsNtlDYWwAnother Muslim handle referred to the arrest of Harsh Mishra as the first one in the ‘mob lynching’ case and claimed that the latter was hiding at his girlfriend’s residence.

He also alleged that the three Muslim males were murdered and demanded strict punishment for the perpetrators. He further threatened, “If justice is not served, we will organize massive protests against the BJP government. We demand accountability and swift action.”The horrific lynching of three Muslim men in Chhattisgarh on June 7th is a clear failure of the BJP government and the state police. These men were brutally attacked while transporting cattle, leading to the tragic deaths of Tehseen Qureshi and Chand Khan, while Saddam Qureshi is… pic.twitter.com/kw4edS3wwKAnother netizen referred to the murders as “saffron terrorists” and called it “business as usual” implying that Muslims regularly die at the hands of Hindus in India. The person also highlighted that the Bharatiya Janata Party emerged victorious on ten out of eleven Lok Sabha seats in Chhattisgarh.Saffron terr0r!sts mob lynching Muslims – Business as UsualBodies of Chand Miya and Guddu Khan were found in the Mahanadi River, while Saddam Khan is in critical condition🚩BJP won 10 out of 11 seats in Chhattisgarh pic.twitter.com/BfA6Obo1SQUnsurprisingly, after the facts emerged and it was determined that the occurrence was not a mob lynching, the same individuals would neither apologize nor retract their false statements and sectarian remarks they had previously circulated to disparage Hindus and the BJP. It is pertinent to note that the Islamist-liberal ecosystem has been exposed multiple times in the past, although they brazenly continue to point fingers at Hindus while simultaneously ignoring or whitewashing hundreds of similar assaults where the majority community has come under attack and killed by the Muslims.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"18 July, 2024","Ravindra Pal alias Dara Singh has been in jail for 24 years without parole, Odisha govt kept the file pending despite multiple recommendations for...",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/dara-singh-alias-ravindra-pal-has-been-in-odisha-jail-for-24-years-without-parole/,"Arvind Kumar Pal has said that Dara Singh alias Ravindra Kumar Pal is now more than 60 years old, and in this situation, he should be allowed to spend the rest of his life among his family members in his ancestral residenceOn 9th July, the brother of Ravindra Kumar Pal, also known as Dara Singh, submitted a plea in the Supreme Court appealing for the latter’s release who is currently serving sentences ranging from one to life imprisonment in four different cases. Advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain will represent Arvind Kumar Pal in the court. On 14 July, the OpIndia team went to the house of Dara Singh, who has been behind bars in Odisha for the last 24 years and met his family to inquire about the matter. Dara Singh is originally from the Uttar Pradesh district of Auraiya. We took a train from Delhi to Phaphund, which is the closest station to his hometown and took a private vehicle to Bazar Kakod on the way to Auraiya City, which is about 10 kilometres away.When we stopped to ask a rider for directions along the route, he asked us straight away in a frustrated tone, “Is he the same Dara Singh who killed the priest who converted Hindus to Christianity? He has suffered grave injustice.” Anyway, he showed us the way and we arrived at the residence of Dara Singh’s brother Arvind Kumar, located in the town of Kakod. He has preserved most of the documents of the legal battle he fought for Dara Singh for 24 years.We finally made it to Dara Singh’s home and met his brother Arvind Kumar Pal. He informed us that letters regarding Dara Singh’s release have been sent from the jail to the Superintendent of Police and District Magistrate of Auraiya from time to time. The DM and SP advocated for his release in response to the letters. However, the Odisha government at the time disregarded the requests. Arvind Pal provided us with evidence in the form of a letter dated 28th February 2018, which was sealed and signed by the District Magistrate of Auraiya and was sent as a reply to a report sought from Keonjhar Jail, Odisha on 18th November 2017. “It is recommended to release Ravindra Kumar Pal alias Dara Singh on premature release,” the officer wrote in letter number 821, citing the district superintendent of police’s report.OpIndia also has the letter issued by the Superintendent of Police Auraiya on 18th January 2018 in which he considered Dara Singh as eligible for release. Afterwards, on 22nd September 2022, once again SP Auraiya filed his remarks on the report sought by Keonjhar Jail of Odisha and suggested the early release of Dara Singh. Speaking to OpIndia, Arvind Kumar Pal claimed that the previous Odisha government ignored multiple pleas for Dara Singh’s release from the Uttar Pradesh government. He blamed the Biju Janata Dal administration, which was headed by Naveen Patnaik, the Odisha chief minister at the time.Dara Singh’s younger brother further told us that after the Odisha government repeatedly ignored the report of the administrative officials of Uttar Pradesh, he appealed to the Prime Minister’s Office and sent a letter on 19th May 2021 demanding the release of Dara Singh. Arvind Kumar Pal contended that his older brother, Ravindra Kumar Pal, also known as Dara Singh, had never been granted parole in the previous 21 years, in the letter. In addition, he brought several other issues to the government’s notice. He noted that the Odisha government’s only answer was to postpone the issue when the Prime Minister’s Office asked for a response to this letter.Arvind Kumar Pal showed us a letter dated 14th July 2021, which was issued by the Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Jail of Odisha. He notified the Odisha Home Secretary in this letter that on 9th July of the same year, the Superintendent of Keonjhar Jail turned in a report which covered the whole matter. The DIG Jail had put the ball in the court of the state government.OpIndia investigated the report filed by the Superintendent of Keonjhar Jail, Odisha on 9th July 2021. The Jail Superintendent has admitted that till July 2021, Dara Singh has served more than 25 years and 3 months of his sentence including remission. The Jail Superintendent authorized higher authorities for further action. However, Arvind Kumar Pal charged that no decision has been taken by the Odisha government on this report so far and the file has been put on hold.Dara Singh is from the Auraiya district’s Dibiyapur police station region. The district government obtained Dara Singh’s information via the local police station following the request for a report to be made in order to secure his release from Odisha jail. Sub Inspector Sher Singh of the Dibiyapur police station handed in his investigation report on 15th September 2022 which pointed out that Dara Singh does not have a criminal record on file with the police station. The local police station officer also called for Dara Singh’s early release in his probe report.The Superintendent of Keonjhar District Jail of Odisha issued a character certificate to Ravindra Kumar Pal alias Dara Singh on 10th June 2022 in which he noted that the latter has been serving jail term in Keonjhar Jail for the last 15 years. Out of this, 3 years of the sentence has been served in the presence of the then Jail Superintendent who issued the certificate and described Dara Singh as a person with good and satisfactory behaviour towards jail personnel and other inmates.Arvind Kumar Pal also sent a letter to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on 11th March 2023 and requested for help, informing that Dara Singh had not received parole for 23 years. He has also given information about the recommendation of Dara Singh’s release several times by the administrative officials of Uttar Pradesh. Arvind Kumar Pal has said that Dara Singh alias Ravindra Kumar Pal is now more than 60 years old, in the letter and in this situation, he should be allowed to spend the rest of his life among his family members in his ancestral residence.Arvind Kumar Pal told us that from the police station in charge of Uttar Pradesh to the SP and DM, all were constantly recommending the release of his brother. His behaviour was also mentioned as good in the jail certificate. In the report of the Odisha administration, his sentence has been counted as more than 25 years (including exemption). The state government of Odisha kept circulating the letter to the Prime Minister’s Office. In such a situation, he sees the Supreme Court as his last hope.The Odisha state government, the jail DG, and the jail superintendent Keonjhar have been named as opponents in Arvind Kumar Pal’s petition. The petition’s next hearing is scheduled for 27th August of this year. The family of Dara Singh is hoping for justice. Arvind Kumar asserted that the Odisha state government would have to inform the Supreme Court of the length of a life sentence and the fact that numerous Naxalites and other infamous offenders have been freed from prison after serving 15 years in the state.Read the report in Hindi here.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

We all heard her. Every CM was given the allotted time and that was displayed on the screen which was present before every table…She said in the media that her mic was put off. That is completely false, ” Sitharaman told ANI.“Every CM was given their due time to speak…It’s unfortunate that the chief minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee has claimed that her mic was switched off which is not true…She should speak the truth behind this rather than again build a narrative based on falsehood,” the Union Finance Minister said.According to the government fact check body PIB, Mamata Banerjee’s turn to speak would be only after lunch if one goes alphabetically but she was “accomodated” as the seventh speaker on an official request from the Chief Minister.“Alphabetically, CM, West Bengal turn would have come after lunch. She was accommodated as the 7th speaker on an official request of the West Bengal government as she had to return early,” PIB Fact Check explained in a subsequent tweet.Earlier today speaking to reporters, the West Bengal Chief Minister alleged “political discrimination” and said that at the NITI Aayog meeting she was not allowed to speak for more than five minutes while other chief ministers were given more time.“…I said you (central government) should not discriminate against state governments. I wanted to speak but my mic was muted. I was allowed to speak only for five minutes.

This is insulting…,” Banerjee said as she walked out mid way from the meeting.“I have come out boycotting the NITI Aayog meeting. Chandrababu Naidu was given 20 minutes to speak, Chief Ministers of Assam, Goa, Chhattisgarh spoke for 10-12 minutes. I was stopped after just 5 minutes. This is unfair,” the Chief Minister said speaking to reporters after coming out of the meeting.Claiming that she had chosen to participate in the meeting to strengthen “cooperative federalism” Banerjee said, “There are many regional aspirations. That is why I am here, to share those aspirations. If a state is strong, the Union will be strong.”The Chief Minister said that several states, including West Bengal, were deprived in the Union Budget that was presented in Parliament this week,Asking the central government to treat states equally, Banerjee said, “Bengal has been deprived of MNREGA funds for the last three years, nothing was paid. Treat all states equally. I said that today. I am speaking on behalf of all the states which have been deprived.”Hitting out at the central government over the Budget, the Chief Minister said that the Centre does not support “cooperative federalism.”“From the Opposition side, I am here to strengthen cooperative federalism. But you are not for cooperative federalism. The Budget is totally politically biased. Why discriminate against other states?” Banerjee said.The Trinamool Congress supremo also asked the Centre to give financial powers to NITI Aayog or bring back the Planning Commission.“NITI Aayog has no financial powers, how will it work? Give it financial powers, or bring back the Planning Commission,” she said.Chief Ministers of opposition-led states including Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Telangana, Delhi and Punjab boycotted the NITI Aayog meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.On Wednesday, Chief Minister of Punjab Bhagwant Mann and Telangana Chief Minister Revanth Reddy said that their government will boycott the NITI Aayog in protest against the central government’s alleged injustice to the state in the allocation of funds in the 2024 Union Budget.(This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

"27 July, 2024","A day after CCTV footage of brutal murder of 22-year-old Bihar girl in a Bengaluru PG went viral, the accused man arrested from Madhya...",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/bengaluru-pg-murder-bihar-accused-arrested-madhya-pradesh/,"Police had added that the accused sneaked into the PG hostel and slit Kriti's throat with a knife near her room on the third floor at 11.30 pm on Tuesday (23rd July).On Saturday (27th July), Police arrested the accused who brutally stabbed a 22-year-old Bihar girl to death inside her Paying Guest accommodation in Bengaluru, Karnataka, earlier this week. Following the incident, the man absconded from Bengaluru and was hiding in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, from where he was taken into custody. The development comes a day after the Police released CCTV footage of the murder which captured the gruesome incident. The accused has been identified as Abhishek, a Bihar resident, and the ex-boyfriend of the victim’s PG roommate. The victim identified as Kriti Kumari, was also from Bihar. She had been staying at the PG since March this year. As per the Police officials, she was working as a business development associate at a project-based learning platform. According to the Police, during the investigation, they found out that Abhishek frequented the victim’s PG where he often had arguments with his girlfriend. However, the deceased victim would often intervene in their arguments. Police added that Kriti Kumari had urged her roommate to stop living with the accused and move with her. According to the Police, on the day of the incident, the accused was seen carrying luggage and was allowed entry by PG security when Kriti claimed that he was her brother and that he would leave soon.Police have blamed the negligence of the PG owner for the incident. According to Police sources, a few days earlier, Kriti Kumari’s roommate had moved out of the paying guest accommodation. It is suspected that she had gone to stay with her boyfriend.However, on 23rd July, she returned to the PG to stay with Kriti Kumari. According to Police sources, the accused doubted that Kriti Kumari could have persuaded his girlfriend to change her decision. According to the Police, the brutal murder took place at around 11 PM at the Bhargavi Staying Homes For Ladies in Venkatreddy Layout. Reportedly, the PG is just over a kilometre away from the South East Deputy Commissioner of Police’s office and the Koramangala police station.As per the CCTV footage, moments before the incident, the accused Abhishek had walked up to Kriti’s room in the PG and knocked on her door. A few moments later, he is seen dragging her out. Despite strenuous efforts by the victim to resist the knife attack, he repeatedly stabbed the victim. Abhishek then fled the crime scene when girls from the PG heard the victim’s cries for help.This happened in a PG hostel in Koramangala, Bengaluru 3 days ago The killer has not been caught yet He brutally killed Kriti Kumari by slitting her neck which was caught in CCTV camera but police haven’t caught him yet. This is how Law and order has deteriorated in our city… pic.twitter.com/vMO1SZykGvThe Koramangala Police Inspector Nataraj had earlier stated that the Police registered a case under Section 103 (murder) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) and initiated an investigation.Police had added that the accused sneaked into the PG hostel and slit Kriti’s throat with a knife near her room on the third floor at 11.30 pm on Tuesday (23rd July).

"27 July, 2024","Uttar Pradesh: Speeding car travelling on the wrong side hits Hindu devotees, damages a Kanwar, Islamists and media paint accused Muslim man in car...",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/speeding-car-on-the-wrong-side-hits-kanwariyas-islamists-and-media-paint-accused-muslim-car-occupant-as-victim/,"It was later found out that the accused occupants in the car belonged to the Muslim faith, which triggered Islamists to peddle the boogie of ‘Muslim victimhood’ and launch a smear campaign against Kanwar YatraOn Friday (26th July) evening, a speeding car travelling on the wrong side of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway hit Hindu devotees part of the Kanwar Yatra and collided with a Kanwar. As per reports, the collision impact damaged the Kanwar making the aggrieved Kanwariya’s Yatra futile. Following the incident, Kanwariyas attempted to confront and nab the accused car occupants which led to clashes. While three out of the four accused fled from the crime scene, Kanwariyas caught one accused and handed him over to the Police. However, it was later found out that the accused occupants in the car belonged to the Muslim faith, which triggered Islamists to peddle the boogie of ‘Muslim victimhood’ and launch a smear campaign against Kanwar Yatra, a religious Hindu practice. Additionally, the media reports on the incident have also painted the accused car occupants as victims and blatantly accuse Kanwariyas of indulging in violence, vandalism, and terrorising Muslim car occupants for a “minor incident”.   According to reports, the incident took place on Friday evening in Partapur near the T-point where the Delhi-Dehradun Highway and Delhi-Meerut Expressway intersect. The car which was travelling on the wrong side hit the Kanwar of a Hindu devotee who was marching on foot from Haridwar to Ghaziabad. It broke off his water pot thus ending his religious yatra before its culmination. Notably, Hindu devotees bring Ganga Jal (holy water) from Gaumukh, Gangotri in Uttarakhand, and other holy rivers to do Jal Abhishek of Shiv ji in their revered nearby temples. For this, they accumulate water in pots or other containers in Kanwar and do Padyatra from these holy cities back to their hometown.    After the speeding car travelling on the wrong side ramped into their yatra, the Kanwariyas attempted to nab the accused car occupants which escalated into violent clashes between them. However, three out of the four accused managed to flee the area to avoid getting arrested by the Police. But the Kanwariyas caught one accused and assaulted him before handing him over to the Police. Meanwhile, after getting the information, SP Traffic Raghavendra Singh, CO Brahmapuri Pramod Kumar, and CEO Suchita Singh reached the spot with heavy police force and pacified the matter.They convinced the Kanwariyas and made travel arrangements for the victim Kanwariya to fetch Ganga Jal again from Haridwar. Additionally, the police took the car involved in the accident into custody and sent it to the police yard.Narrating the incident, the Kanwariyas recounted that the car was coming from the wrong side. They added that the riders didn’t pay heed to their warnings that they were driving on the wrong side of the road and could end up hurting Kanwariyas or disrupting their Yatra. The Kanwariyas said, “The Kanwar has been broken due to the collision. We signaled the car riders that we were carrying the Kanwar and that they were coming from the wrong side, but they ignored us. This is why this accident happened. Our Kanwar was broken.”Infuriated by the incident, the Kanwariyas demanded that the miscreant car occupants be handed over to the Police and that they should face strict actions for their act. However, it led to a violent confrontation and while the three accused managed to flee, the Kanwariyas assaulted one of them and handed him over to the Police.   However, media reports about the incident have painted victim Kanwariyas as the aggressor and accused them of assaulting and vandalising the car of the Muslim occupants for a minor collision incident. Soon, usual suspects and Islamists started peddling the boogie of Muslim victimhood and presented it as a near-lynching incident to launch smear campaigns against the Hindu religious Kanwar Yatra. #Kanwad yatra is open license to hooliganism.

"27 July, 2024","As Bhim Army Chief Chandrashekhar Azad ‘Ravan’ pushes for private sector reservations, a look at the economic and social pitfalls of such a step",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/bhim-army-chief-chandrashekhar-azad-private-sector-reservations/,"The bill proposes that the Central government must incentivise private sector entities to implement reservations for SCs, STs, and OBCs by giving them special concessions and facilitating lower-interest loans through nationalised banks.On Friday (26th July), Azad Samaj Party MP from Uttar Pradesh’s Nagina and Bhim Army Chief, Chandra Shekhar Azad introduced a private member bill in Lok Sabha to extend reservations for the SCs, STs, and OBCs in the private sector. The bill is titled, ‘The Reservation for the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes and the Other Backward Classes in Private Sector Act, 2024’. आज मैने लोक सभा में 3 निम्नलिखित गैर सरकारी विधेयक पेश किए-1. निजी क्षेत्रों में अनुसूचित जातियों,अनुसूचित जनजातियों और अन्य पिछड़े वर्गों के लिये आरक्षण की व्यवस्था।2. अनुसूचित जातियों तथा अनुसूचित जनजातियों के बच्चों के लिये आवासीय स्कूल।3. देश मे सभी बालकों को उच्च एवम्… pic.twitter.com/25YDIPZ9ZwCurrently, reservations are only applicable in the public sector and there is no reservation in the private sector. The bill proposes to change this and extend reservation benefits to the SC, ST, and OBC communities in the private sector as well. The bill introduced by Bhim Army Chief Ravan seeks to extend reservations in the private sector, educational institutions, and other establishments that have no government financial interest and employ at least 20 people. The bill proposes that the Central government must incentivise private sector entities to implement reservations for SCs, STs, and OBCs by giving them special concessions and facilitating lower-interest loans through nationalised banks.It also proposes that the government should present an annual report in both houses of Parliament to highlight all actions that have been taken under the Act, in case it is passed by both houses as well as get Presidential assent. The proposed legislation also wants to make it mandatory for the Union government to frame rules to ensure the effective implementation of the Act (if passed). The bill claims to rely on support from Articles 16(4) and 16(4A) of the Constitution. Incidentally, the said article permits reservations in public sector undertakings (PSUs) and financial institutions receiving government grants.In his statement of objects and reasons, the Bhim Army Chief claimed that to ensure equitable growth and socio-economic upliftment, it is imperative to have representation from all sections of the society while highlighting the importance of the private sector in nation-building. Any Member of Parliament (MP) can also introduce proposed legislation in both houses of Parliament and it is known as the Private Members’ Bill. Just like any other bill proposed by the government, a Private Member bill, to become an act, must be passed by both houses and receive Presidential assent. Notably, such bills can only be introduced and discussed on Fridays. Yesterday (on 26th July), as many as 31 private members’ Bills were introduced in the Lok Sabha. Congress MP Shashi Tharoor also moved a private member bill seeking to reserve 10 seats in the Lok Sabha for those below 35 years of age.Today, I introduced three Private member’s bills in the Lok Sabha. One of them would reserve 10 seats in Parliament for people under the age of 35. We already hold the world record for the biggest gap between the average age of the population and the average age of Parliament. It… pic.twitter.com/T43PFDxkHTNonetheless, it is pertinent to note that while Bhim Army Chief Chandrashekhar Azad has proposed to extend reservations for SCs, STs, and OBCs in the private sector, the Congress government in Karnataka recently proposed to extend reservations in the private sector for Kannadigas. Strikingly, the Cabinet led by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah had decided to present seven bills, including 100% reservation for Kannadigas in Category C and D jobs in all private industries in the state. However, the legislation extending reservations in the private sector for Kannadigas triggered massive opposition from top Industry leaders and within the state government, forcing the state government to halt the proposed legislation for want of ‘further discussions’.Extending reservations, either for locals or the backward communities, in the private sector could have long-term and far-reaching consequences for the economy as well as the social fabric of the country. The proposed legislation would have a chilling effect on meritocracy, ease of doing business, and investment opportunities, as well as could lead to social unrest.As a well-established fact, India, or any other country plagued by Licence or quota raj, witnessed sluggish growth for several decades but it has grown leaps and bounds after the economic reforms in 1991 which liberalised the economy and unshackled private sector from needless legislative compliance. At a time when companies are opting out of China and relocating to countries that have skilled labour, stifling meritocracy for vote bank politics, and pushing reservations in the private sector would be catastrophic. This would not only be dragging India back in this highly competitive race of ‘free’ and open market access for new companies, it would be undoing the progress in economic and other key parameters of Human development post the liberalisation era. The strength of the private sector lies in the easy and flexible accessibility of factors of production, including skilled human resources. Barring the CSR aspect, the private sector links its outcomes with high standards of performance audits. However, with reservations in the private sector and elections always around the corner, companies would face mounting pressure from the ruling party in their state of operation to not fire employees despite audit reviews, as well as to improve recruitment from the communities forming political vote bank, thus putting a constraint on their say on Human resources.This has the potential to limit the functionality of companies causing them to find an exit route to ensure their profit margin and escape the wrath of the government’s and administration’s restrictive measures like the job quota compliance. The government/police intervention in the day-to-day functioning of the company’s operation to ensure compliance would render the companies prone to “corruption”, and “bureaucratic red-tapism”, and send the state/country back to the “License quota raj” period, pre-reform era.Furthermore, rather than striving to build an egalitarian society and uplift marginalised society, the bill’s introduction could lead to social unrest, like the protests during the Mandal era when reservations were made applicable only in the public sector which makes up roughly around 2% of the total workforce. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

The woman, named Sobia Batool Shah, told police that her legs were chopped for seeking a divorce from her abusive and deadbeat husband, who never took responsibility for his family.The deeply disturbing act of violence occurred in Gul Town, leaving the victim with severe physical as well as mental trauma, which may result in a lifelong disability–with the possibility that she may never be able to walk again.Reportedly, Syed Mustafa Shah, Sobia’s father, and her uncles Syed Qurban Shah, Ehsan Shah, Shah Nawaz, and Mushtaq Shah, who were armed with axes, injured Sobia and fled the spot, leaving her screaming for help in a pool of blood, according to Geo News. Sobia was rushed to a Nawab Shah hospital as soon as police reached the crime scene.The woman further told police that her husband would regularly abuse her and fail to provide for her and their two children, leaving her to suffer on her own in Karachi.According to Sobia, she repeatedly alerted her parents about the plight she was in, but her family turned a deaf ear to her grievances and dismissed her, calling her a disgrace, as reported by Geo News.After deciding to escape her abusive marriage, Sobia filed for divorce, which incited her father and uncles to confront her.According to the police, Sobia’s enraged parents accused her of bringing dishonour to the family by taking legal action against her husband. When she refused to withdraw her case, they attacked her with axes, they added, reported Geo News.The Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) of Nausharoferoz took immediate notice of the incident and ordered the local station house officer (SHO) to bring all the accused to justice and ensure the victim’s security.Responding to the directions, the police have so far managed to arrest one suspect, Mushtaq Shah, and are still investigating through raids, in search of the remaining culprits.Patriarchal values are embedded in Pakistani society, which determines the subordinated position of women. Patriarchal control over women is exercised through institutionalized restrictive codes of behavior, gender segregation and the ideology which associates family honor to female virtue.The abnormal, amoral, and harmful customary practices which aim at preserving subjugation of women, defended and sanctified as cultural traditions and given religious overtones. Abnormal and amoral traditional practices in Pakistan include honor killing, rape and sexual assault, sexual harassment, acid attacks, being burned, kidnapping, domestic violence, dowry murder, and forces marriages, custodial abuse and torture.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Opening your event by replacing Jesus and the disciples at the The Last Supper with men in drag.

He was also referred to as ‘Bacchus’ by the Romans. He is also considered the patron of theatre, given that his festivals often involve dramatic performances.As a god associated with vegetation and growth, he is linked to the cycles of nature. Dionysus remains a powerful symbol in art, literature, and culture and hence it comes as no wonder that He was featured during the opening ceremony of the 2024 Paris Olympics.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

It is a sorry state of affairs in the capital city and can lead to a public health emergency,” said the bench.The bench posted the matter for further hearing on September 6.The apex court was hearing a case relating to the deteriorating air quality in and around the national capital.In May, the top court expressed concern over the generation of tonnes of untreated solid waste every day in Delhi and said it directly affects the fundamental right of the citizens under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution to live in a pollution-free environment.Terming the situation where 3,800 tonnes of solid waste in Delhi go untreated every day as “horrible,” it had said that immediate measures should be undertaken to ensure that the quantity of untreated solid waste does not increase till proper facilities are put in place to treat them.The bench had earlier noted it was an admitted position by all concerned that within the limits of the MCD, every day 3,800 metric tonnes of solid waste were generated, which cannot be treated as the existing plants do not have the capacity to treat them.It had also said that it was “shocking” that over 3,000 tonnes of the 11,000 tonnes of municipal solid waste generated in Delhi every day were not processed.(This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

She clarified that all states continue to receive their allocations.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman addressed criticisms on NDTV, stating that the 2024 Union Budget did not exclude any state. This was in response to opposition claims that her speech only mentioned Andhra Pradesh and Bihar, both governed by BJP allies. Ms Sitharaman, presenting her seventh consecutive budget, explained that legal obligations require the centre to support Andhra Pradesh post its 2014 bifurcation. She clarified that all states continue to receive their allocations.She noted that multiple steps have been taken over the last decade under the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, and reiterated the centre’s commitment to projects like the Polavaram irrigation project, despite technical delays.Several opposition parties, led by the Congress party, had attacked the Union Budget 2024 over allocations made to Bihar and Andhra Pradesh, with senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi calling it a ‘Khurshi Bachao’ budget but at the same time asserting that it was a copy and paste of Congress manifesto and previous budgets.The Congress-led INDIA bloc criticized the Modi government’s lack of mention or schemes for non-BJP governed states. Congress leaders from Karnataka, Telangana, and Himachal Pradesh announced a boycott of a Niti Aayog meeting chaired by Prime Minister Modi. Subsequently, many opposition chief ministers, including Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin, Himachal Pradesh’s Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu, Karnataka’s Siddaramaiah, and Telangana’s Revanth Reddy, decided to boycott the Niti Ayog meeting citing ‘unfairness’ in the Union Budget. Tamil Nadu’s DMK also pointed out a lack of provisions for local infrastructure projects. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin warned that while the budget might support the government, it does not address national needs.Ms Sitharaman responded, emphasizing that no budget can mention every state, and omission from the speech does not mean a lack of funding. She countered Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge’s critique, highlighting the simplicity and transparency of the budget presentation, aligning with Prime Minister Modi’s vision.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"26 July, 2024",Is the US carrying out ‘political censorship’ in India under the garb of combating fake news? Here is what we know so far,https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/us-embassy-consulates-counter-disinformation-worshops-india-political-censorship-attempt-explained/,"'Disinfo Lab' pointed out that the US government also forced the likes of Reddit, Amazon and Wikipedia to take down, promote certain forms of literature and make content changes.The United States may be engaging in political censorship in India under the pretext of combating disinformation in the country through its embassies and consulates. The revelation was made by the popular OSINT handle ‘Disinfo Lab’ in a 36-tweet thread on Thursday (25th July). It exposed how the US government had been conducting workshops on ‘counter disinformation’ in various Indian cities, Kolkata, Lucknow, Hyderabad, Chennai, and Mumbai, since 2019.The US Embassy in India has taken a keen interest in ‘fighting disinformation’ and ‘hate speech’, conducting multiple workshops through its consulates and mission. However, the manner and the individuals engaged, raise some questions.A thread: pic.twitter.com/6xV5oRexqoOne such workshop on identifying ‘fake news’ was conducted in Lucknow by a Berlin-based ‘activist’ named Tina Lee. According to screenshots shared by ‘Disinfo Lab’, Lee has a history of amplifying misleading stories, peddling anti-Trump narratives and engaging in partisan behaviour.“Could US taxpayers’ money be used on such partisan individuals? That’s not all,” the OSINT handle pointed out.As to how 'reliable' she'd be as an expert? She's very 'liberal' in calling political opponents 'Fascists'. Could US taxpayers' money be used on such partisan individuals?That's not all. This 'counter disinformation' expert was also found spreading #fakenews –literally.(4/n) pic.twitter.com/fKUfDsuAczIn 2022, the US consulate in Kolkata had also roped in Brittani Kollar – the Deputy Director of MediaWise (digital media literacy project of Poynter). Interestingly, the Poynter Institute received a whopping $3,00,000 (₹25.12 lakhs) in 2017 from far-left billionaire George Soros’ Open Society Foundations (OSF). Soros had been eyeing a colour revolution in India for a long time.The US consulate in Hyderabad had also invited Alanna Dvorak, the International Training Manager of the Poynter-owned International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN). A post shared by U.S. Consulate Kolkata (@usandkolkata)OpIndia had recently reported how the US State Department  has set aside a whopping $2,00,000 (~₹1.67 crores) to recruit fact-checkers in India as part of its ‘Empowering Media Savvy Youth.’ Through this project, the Executive Department of the US federal government claims to confront ‘online manipulation’, combat ‘external influences’, secure digital landscape and reinforce regional security.As pointed out by ‘Disinfo Lab’, the US is using ‘counter disinformation’ to censor free speech on an “industrial scale.” The US House Committee on Weaponization of Federal Government has published a 98-page report in May this year, documenting political censorship.We are not claiming this.The US House Committee on Weaponization of Federal Government, that is documenting the #censorship in media and social media by the US Administration, says so.(that there was a need for such a committee itself is a story)(11/n) pic.twitter.com/TJSaFF0rNcAccording to ‘Disinfo Lab’, there were secret conversations between the CIA and FBI with Facebook officials to censor political posts. The censorship in the name of combating disinformation extended to Google, Instagram, YouTube and X (formerly Twitter) as well.Everyone would have heard of #TwitterFiles –internal Twitter communication revealed by #ElonMusk– which documented how the US Govt agencies- #DHS #FBI #CIA etc. had been running the #censorship industry from within Twitter– in collusion with Twitter senior functionaries.(16/n) pic.twitter.com/ljhdaqj7EcThe OSINT handle pointed out that the US government also forced the likes of Reddit, Amazon and Wikipedia to take down, promote certain forms of literature and make content changes.“The censorship goes far beyond social media.

It was found that her trust had violated FCRA norms. Disinfo Lab stated, “In other words, US govt entities (Embassies and consulates) are engaging the non-govt (IREX – almost entirely peopled with former US govt) – which in turn are funded by other US Govt entities (US Embassies from Israel to Pakistan).”The organization is headed by Kristin M Lord, who had been associated with several ‘non-government’ organizations – USIP, USAID, and CFR.

Despite this, the US Embassy was undeterred from promoting Sayema on their social media handles.In May 2023, ‘America First Legal’ (AFL) exposed how the Global Engagement Centre (GEC) of the US State Department was working with private media outlets to peddle deep state propaganda.A centre-right non-profit organisation, AFL, secured documents against the GEC under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). It noted that millions of conservative Americans were targeted for their social media posts on vaccine mandates, election integrity, and Covid-19 vaccines.The organisation revealed that the Global Engagement Centre (GEC) of the US State Department continues to work closely with George Soros-funded ‘fact checkers’, associated with the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) to control the global media narrative.America First Legal pointed out that the fact-checkers, currently coordinating with GEC, are also funded by the likes of Omidyar Network, Google, Facebook, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.The GEC had been working with IFCN affiliates in countries such as Tunisia and propagating their ‘fact-checking methods’ to censor politically incorrect narratives. According to America First Legal, email exchanges show IFCN pestering the US State Department to ‘fund’ more of their programmes in Egypt.Email transcripts, accessed by America First Legal, show the GEC threatening journalists to compile its talking points in the form of a report and publish it imminently.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"26 July, 2024","Gujarat: ‘Sir tan se Juda’ attempt on VHP member in Bhuj leaving him gravely injured, accused Nizam and Irfan arrested",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/sir-tan-se-juda-attempt-on-hindu-youth-in-bhuj-accused-nizam-and-irfan-arrested/,"The victim said that the accused may have deliberately attacked him due to his pro-Hindu and cow protection-related activism. In Gujarat’s Bhuj, a Vishwa Hindu Parishad activist was brutally assaulted by two Muslim youngsters on 22nd July, leaving him gravely injured. When the injured Hindu youth went to settle a dispute of his friend, in a ‘Sar tan se juda’ [beheading] attempt using a knife, the Hindu youths were attacked by accused Nizam and Irfan. Both the injured youths are being treated at a hospital. Meanwhile, the police have filed a case and initiated an investigation.The victim Bhavesh Parmar resides on Mundra Road in Bhuj city of Kutch district and runs the Bajrang Tea House. The incident began on 19th July, when Madhapur police took some rickshaws into custody for operating rickshaws illegally. Meanwhile, local journalist Raju Prajapati captured images of the police action. Nizam and Irfan then called Raju to arrange a meeting. Raju conveyed this to his friend and VHP worker Bhavesh Parmar, who then went to meet Nizam-Irfan.OpIndia has obtained a copy of the FIR. In his complaint, Bhavesh stated that he, Raju Prajapati, and another friend arrived at Jubilee Circle, where Nizam and Irfan also came. Subsequently, Nizam attacked Raju in the chest. Bhavesh attempted to settle the tension, but Nizam pulled out a knife and stabbed him in the throat. Bhavesh tried to flee in this attack, but the knife stabbed his left shoulder. Nizam and Irfan fled as he called for help after bleeding profusely. Before escaping, they both threatened to kill Bhavesh if they spotted him anywhere. Later, both of Bhavesh’s friends brought him to a nearby hospital, where he is receiving medical care.गुजरात के #कच्छ में बढ़ती इस्लामिक आक्रामकता- “विश्व हिंदू परिषद” के गौ रक्षक पर Gहादीयो ने किया जानलेवा हमला।22/07/2024 की शाम 8 बजे #भुज में विश्व हिंदू परिषद के कार्यकर्ता #भावेश_परमार पर Gहादी #मोहम्मद_निज़ाम और Gहादी #इरफ़ान_ब्लॉच ने जान से मारने के सुनियोजित षडियंत्र के… pic.twitter.com/JQT5cJZ2XvNotably, victim Bhavesh Parmar is a Hindu rights group Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) member and is actively involved in Gau Raksha work. Speaking to OpIndia, Bhavesh said that he had no idea that the accused Muslim youths would attack him. Bhavesh told us that Nizam and Irfan were aware that he is a VHP member and a Gau Rakshak. The victim said that the accused may have deliberately attacked him due to his pro-Hindu and cow protection-related activism. Bhavesh added that the authorities are taking action in the matter, however, stringent action should be taken on those attacking Gau Rakshaks and Hindu activists to set an example. The Hindu victim demanded that the authorities raze down the houses of the accused Muslim youths.In this case, Bhuj-B Division Police has registered a case and arrested Nizam Mughal and Irfan Baloch. A case has been registered against them under BNS sections 109, 115(2), 296(B), 351(2), 61(2)(B) and section 135(1). Both the accused have been sent to jail in judicial custody.However, questions have been raised of police action since despite the seriousness of the matter, the police did not seek the remand of accused Nizam and Irfan due to which the duo has been sent to judicial custody. Meanwhile, it has emerged that the accused duo has other cases filed against them and there is a demand to invoke the Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Act, 1985 (PASA) against them. OpIndia tried to obtain further information from the police, however, they could not be contacted.

"26 July, 2024",Royal Moidams of Assam’s Ahom dynasty included in the UNESCO World Heritage List: All you need to know about the 700-year-old mound burial system,https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/royal-moidams-of-assams-ahom-dynasty-included-in-unesco-world-heritage-list/,"Moidams were burial mounds utilized by the Ahom dynasty, who controlled Assam between the 13th and 19th centuries. The mounds are predominantly located in the Sivasagar district, the former capital of the Ahom dynasty. Each moidam houses the remains of Ahom royalty and other notable individuals.On Friday, 26th July, the Ahom dynasty’s “Moidams” mound-burial system in Assam was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List. The decision was made during the 46th session of the World Heritage Committee (WHC), which is taking place in Delhi, the national capital.“This was made possible through the efforts of the Assam government and the leadership under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, we are proud and grateful for the 43rd Indian addition to the World Heritage List”, said Union Minister of Culture Gajendra Singh Shekhawat during the meeting. A matter of immense joy and pride for India!The Moidams at Charaideo showcase the glorious Ahom culture, which places utmost reverence to ancestors. I hope more people learn about the great Ahom rule and culture. Glad that the Moidams join the #WorldHeritage List. https://t.co/DyyH2nHfCFAssam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma also made the statement via his official X (previously Twitter) account. “THIS IS HUGE.

The mounds are predominantly located in the Sivasagar district, the former capital of the Ahom dynasty. Each moidam houses the remains of Ahom royalty and other notable individuals. The building entails forming a dome-shaped mound with a surrounding wall.Building a moidam normally involves multiple processes, including placing the corpse in a precise posture, adding offerings, and covering the structure with the soil. As per the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), the World Heritage Committee’s advisory organization, the selected site has 90 modiams of various sizes that were built during 600 years, as well as other cultural assets such as ceremonial routes and sources of water.They state that the moidams are an unusual example of an Ahom necropolis that portrays burial practices and accompanying beliefs tangibly.According to the website of the United Nations Cultural Agency, the Ahom clan established their capital in various regions of the Brahmaputra River Valley between the 12th and 18th centuries after migrating from China. They founded the first capital in the Patkai highlands of eastern India and named it Charaideo, which translates to a dazzling city above the mountain in their language. Even though the clan travelled between towns, the burial site they established was considered the most hallowed sanctuary for the royals’ departed souls.Around 27 nominations were examined by UNESCO before including Moidams of Assam’s Ahom dynasty in the UNESCO World Heritage List. The list of 27 nominations included Beijing Central Axis (China), Schwerin Residence Ensemble (Germany), Sado Island Gold Mines (Japan), Umm Al-Jimāl (Jordan), The Historic Town and Archaeological Site of Gedi (Kenya), The Archaeological Heritage of Niah National Park’s Caves Complex (Malaysia), Saint Hilarion Monastery/ Tell Umm Amer (Palestine), The Colonial Transisthmian Route of Panamá (Panama), Brâncusi Monumental Ensemble of Târgu Jiu (Romania) among others.As informed on the UNESCO official site, it is believed that ninety moidams – hollow vaults built of brick, stone or earth – of different sizes are found within the site. “They contain the remains of kings and other royals together with grave goods such as food, horses and elephants, and sometimes queens and servants. The Tai-Ahom rituals of “Me-Dam-Me-Phi” and “Tarpan” are practised at the Charaideo necropolis. While moidams are found in other areas within the Brahmaputra Valley, those found at the property are regarded as exceptional,” UNESCO stated.UNESCO World Heritage Sites in India are extraordinary locations with cultural, ecological, or combined importance. They highlight India’s contributions to human civilization and have a huge impact on tourism, education, and the local economy. These landmarks play an important role in protecting and promoting India’s identity and heritage on a global scale. Notably, India has the sixth-largest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the world.India has a broad range of UNESCO World Heritage Sites that showcase its rich cultural heritage and breathtaking natural surroundings. These sites include ancient temples, historical cities, intricate stepwells, lush animal sanctuaries, and revered mountain ranges, all of which provide a view into India’s rich cultural and ecological fabric. As of 2023, India had 42 UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Of these, 34 are cultural, seven are natural, and one is of mixed ancestry. Now a new one has been added to the list making the total 43. The total 43 World Heritage sites recognized by the United Nations are- Agra Fort, Ajanta Caves, Ellora Caves, Taj Mahal, Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram, Konark Sun Temple, Churches and Convents of Goa, Fatehpur Sikri, Group of Monuments at Hampi, Khajuraho Group of Monuments, Elephanta Caves, Great Living Chola Temples, Group of Monuments at Pattadakal, Shantiniketan, Buddhist Monuments at Sanchi, Mountain Railways of India, Humayun’s Tomb in Delhi, Humayun’s Tomb in Delhi, Mahabodhi Temple Complex at Bodh Gaya, Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka, Champaner-Pavagadh Archaeological Park, Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (formerly Victoria Terminus, Red Fort Complex, Jantar Mantar, Hill Forts of Rajasthan, Rani Ki Vav (The Queen’s Stepwell), Archaeological Site of Nalanda Mahavira at Nalanda, The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier, an Outstanding Contribution to the Modern Movement, Historic City of Ahmedabad, Victorian Gothic and Art Deco Ensembles of Mumbai, Jaipur city, Kakatiya Rudreshwara (Ramappa) Temple, Dholavira, Sacred Ensembles of the Hoysala, Sundarbans National Park, Western Ghats, Nanda Devi and Valley of Flowers National Parks, Manas Wildlife Sanctuary, Great Himalayan National Park, Keoladeo National Park, Kaziranga National Park, Khangchendzonga National Park and now, the newly added Moidams – the Mound-Burial System of the Ahom Dynasty located in Assam.

The Hindu organisation demanded the demolition of the unlawfully under-constructed mosque near the place. The protesters staged a protest charging that attempts were underway to portray a plot of property in the Chilkur neighbourhood as waqf land. They insisted that no construction related to any other religion should take place in the area surrounding the Chilkur Balaji temple.CS Rangarajan, Archaka of Chilkur Balaji Devasthanam expressed, “The ground surrounding the Chilkur Balaji temple is holy and has existed for a very long period. Just like the land surrounding Tirupati Balaji temple is revered, the area surrounding Chilkur Balaji temple is equally sacred and the Lord is the rightful owner because Lord Venkateshwara has manifested himself in Cilkur. This is not a place for houses of worship for other religions.” He noted that it is the responsibility of police, revenue and other departments to implement the same.He further added, “There is a new masjid (mosque) being built within two kilometres of the temple. They are our brothers as well, and we love and respect them, but this is a request to the government and those building masjids that the land’s sanctity and proprietorship be upheld. This is our respectful plea to the administration and collector’s office. The government should ensure that no new places of worship for any other religion are permitted to be built here.” Breaking news#Muslims are planning to build musjeed near our #chilkur_Balaji_temple.Violence between Hindus and Muslims.

They accused the incumbent Congress administration of Muslim appeasement and declared that the oppressive action of the party which is biased towards Mulsim would be exposed. The authorities eventually took down the structure after a large number of Hindu activists demonstrated against the move under the banner of Bajrang Dal.The state convenor of Bajrang Dal, Shivaramulu, asked that the local tehsildar be suspended immediately for fabricating a report claiming that the private land was waqf land. He accused that after bowing before the Muslim MLC and digging borewells at the site, the police themselves were present and terrorising the locals while carrying out construction work. He warned that the Hindu community would respond to the conspiracy against it.After the protest by Hindu activists and CS Rangarajan who asked for the authority to pay heed to their request, the District Collector immediately took cognizance of the matter and halted the mosque’s construction.

"26 July, 2024",‘Ban on govt officials joining RSS was arbitrary and without material evidence’: Here’s what MP HC said while lamenting over the five-decade-old ban,https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/ban-on-govt-officials-joining-rss-was-arbitrary-mp-hc-laments-it-took-five-decades-to-correct-the-mistake/,"""The moratorium on joining RSS must preferably be by way of the Conduct rules only and not through executive framed Official Memorandums, as it results in infringement of precious fundamental rights of not only the Central Government employees as the citizens of the country, but also members and office bearers of the organisation serving the country as part of RSS,"" the Madhya Pradesh HC noted. In a major vindication for Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the Madhya Pradesh High Court ruled on 25th July that Office Memorandums (OMs) passed by the Congress government in the years 1966, 1970 and 1980 to ban RSS was “arbitrary” and lacked any substantial material to conclude that the association of government employees with RSS should be banned for the sake of India’s communal fabric and secular character.The Division Bench comprising Justices Sushrut Arvind Dharmadhikari and Gajendra Singh ruled that executive-framed official memorandums cannot prohibit RSS membership since they are not the law of the land under Article 13(3)(a).“The moratorium on joining RSS must preferably be by way of the Conduct rules only and not through executive framed Official Memorandums, as it results in infringement of precious fundamental rights of not only the Central Government employees as the citizens of the country, but also members and office bearers of the organisation serving the country as part of RSS. OMs do not constitute a ‘law’ issued under Article 13(3)(a) of the Constitution of India, more so when they are issued on a piece of paper by the subordinate officers of the Central Government purportedly in the name of the sovereign”, the court said.The court also said that even though the Central Government during the pendency of the present writ petition has decided to review and remove the name of RSS from the list of ‘don’t join’ organisations, the court holds that any such exercise of proposing and restoring its name in the of ‘don’t join’ list ever in future must be preceded by a profound thought process, intensive deliberations backed by substantial material and evidence that indicates why RSS and its subsidiaries should be banned from participation by any of the Central Government employee.“Other than political, why its religious, social, educational, health-related community services also invite a similar treatment to be also delved deep into, before holding the same to be a facet of misconduct under Rule 5 of the CCS Rules, 1964,” the court order reads.The court also commented extensively on the apolitical nature of the work performed by RSS and its umbrella groups and NGOs, as well as how the Central Governments were wrong in including it on the “don’t join” list. “The issuance of the OMs painting the whole universe of even the apolitical activities of RSS as communal, anti-secular and against national interest is a decision having drastic consequences, not only for the organisation but also everybody aspiring to associate with it with the noble interest of rendering community & public service,” the court said.The High Court made these observations while hearing the plea of a retired central government employee Purushottam Gupta seeking permission to join the RSS. Gupta, through his counsel Manish Nair had moved High Court in September 2023. In his plea, Gupta contended that the rules that stopped him from joining the RSS were “an impediment for him to gratify his desires at the dusk of his life”. Notably, petitioner Purushottam Gupta has also challenged the constitutional legality of subrules 12, 12A, and 13 of Rule 5 of the CCS(Conduct), 1965, arguing that they are extra vires as it include the RSS.It is pertinent to mention that on the 10th of July, a day after the Modi government issued a notification dropping the RSS as a political party with which government officials cannot be linked, the Union of India submitted an affidavit in this court informing it of the order.The Madhya Pradesh High Court raised the question of any empirical data, survey or any sort of report suggesting that the activities of RSS and its subsidiaries precipitate “communal bias” or that the involvement of government employees in RSS activities could be deemed “anti-secular” was relied on before placing RSS on the “don’t join” list. Expressing displeasure over the failure of the Union of India (UoI) to file a reply in this regard despite repeated inquiries, the court observed that there was no such material evidence that the governments that banned RSS in 1966, 1970, and 1980, relied on to decide that central government employees should be barred from partaking in RSS activities to uphold the communal fabric and secular character of the country.“…perhaps there was never any material, study, survey or report at the relevant point of time based on which the ruling dispensation arrived at a satisfaction that involvement and engagement of central government employees even with the apolitical/non-political activities of RSS must be banned for maintaining the communal fabric and secular character of the country,” the court said.Notably, on the 6th of May, the court expressed its dismay that the case had been pending for ten months since the Union of India had not filed a response to Gupta’s petition. On the 22nd of May Solicitor General of India Tushar Mehta appeared via video conferencing before the court, requesting time to file a response.Coming back to the final order dated 25th July further stated that on 5 different dates during the hearing of Purushottam Gupta’s petition, they questioned the basis of issuance of the impugned circulars/ OMs that “handcuffed the freedom of lakhs of Central Government employees of the country for almost five decades from the 1960s till 2024.”In its order, the court listed three questions that arose in their mind. The first was whether any compelling material, survey or study was taken into account suggesting that RSS should be included in the “don’t join” list and if such material actually existed or the decision was solely based on the ipse dixit of the relevant Central governments to crush an organisation ideologically opposed to them. In simple words, “ipse dixit” means any assertion or statement made by someone based solely on their authority, without any supporting evidence whatsoever.In its second question, the court asked whether the requirement of continuing RSS in the “don’t join” list was periodically reviewed and the desirability examined frequently to retain such prohibition for all the Central government.Thirdly, the court asked if indeed certain material, survey or study was relied on to put RSS in the “don’t join” list, then whether the current Central government considered any fresh material before removing RSS from the list “overnight”.The court observed that if any material or evidence has been collected before removing RSS from the list of “don’t join” organisations then in future, the government must take into consideration compelling reasons backed by data to push RSS back into the list. If RSS is re-added to the list otherwise, then it will “plainly play foul of Articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution of India of the concerned employee, who has emotional and ideological alignment with the RSS.”The court noted that Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh is the only nationally established self-driven voluntary organisation outside the governmental bureaucratic hierarchy attracting the highest membership from various districts across the country actively partaking in “religious, social, educational, health and many apolitical activities, under its umbrella, which have no pertinence to political activities of RSS.” The court noted that the majority of the activities of RSS are not related to politics but varied social arenas. For this, the court cited the example of Rashtriya Seva Bharti (RSB), which works to “organise a peer group with nationalist thoughts and patriotic sentiments under one umbrella”.The court also mentioned Saraswati Shishu Mandirs, “where lakhs of students from impoverished backgrounds receive primary and higher secondary education”. The court also highlighted the social and philanthropic facet of RSS saying that its field volunteers 11 actively engage in large-scale rehabilitation, resettlement, and disaster management support programs, especially the flood relief support being provided nowadays in many States. “Even this social and philanthropic wing of RSS may not identify itself with its political face, but concerns only with the philanthropic face of the organisation,” the court said.“…that membership of RSS per se may not aim at or drive oneself always to the involvement in the political activities of the organisation, much less being engaged in communal or anti-national or anti-secular activities,” the court observed.The court emphasised that RSS and its sister organisations undertake several apolitical activities purely out of community service without any political ambitions.After pointing out the vast contributions of RSS in nation-building through its apolitical activities, the court, though not involving RSS, mentioned several past cases to observe that “voluntary membership of a national & internationally famed organisation like RSS, for activities other than political in nature, like religious, social, philanthropic, educational cannot be proscribed through executive instructions.”Furthermore, the Madhya Pradesh High Court bench sitting in Indore lamented the fact that it took five decades for the Centre to rectify the mistake of the erstwhile Congress government of wrongly placing an internationally famed organisation like RSS on the list of banned organisations. Moreover, justices S.A. Dharmadhikari and Gajendra Singh said that the aspirations of numerous central government employees were “diminished” due to this arbitrary ban.“The Court also laments the fact that it took almost five decades for the Central Government to realise its mistake; to acknowledge that an internationally renowned organisation like RSS was wrongly placed amongst the banned organisations of the country and that its removal therefrom is quintessential. Aspirations of many central government employees to serve the countries in many ways, therefore got diminished in these five decades because of this ban, which was removed only when it was brought to the notice of this Court vide the present proceedings,” the High Court bench said.To raise awareness about the removal of RSS from the list of ‘don’t join’ organisations, the Department of Personnel and Training and the Ministry of Home Affairs, GOI has been directed by the court to post the contents of a recently issued circular on the Home Page of their official websites. Within nine days, the circular shall be distributed to all relevant ministries and undertakings of the Central Government, the court said.As reported earlier, the Modi government lifted a 58-year-old ban on government employees participating in the activities of RSS on 9th July 2024. This prohibition was enacted in November 1966 during the tenure of then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Notably, the 1966 banning order by the Indira Gandhi government came right after the RSS-backed Cow Protection/ Anti-Cow Slaughter Movement on 7th November 1966. OpIndia reported how Congress hounded people who were actively associated with RSS or had participated in its activities in the past were prevented from joining government jobs or were removed from their posts. The authorities used to stop candidates from joining government services after it turned out during police verification that they had or had in the past, links with RSS.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"26 July, 2024",‘Transparency and informed choice of the consumer was the idea behind the decision’: UP govt defends Kanwar Yatra ‘nameplate’ order in SC,https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/transparency-informed-choice-of-consumer-idea-behind-decision-up-govt-defends-kanwar-yatra-nameplate-order-in-sc/,"The UP administration stated, ""It may be noted that the idea behind the directives is transparency and informed choice of the consumer/Kanwaria regarding the food they eat during the period of the Yatra, keeping in mind their religious sentiments so that they don't, even accidentally, fall foul of their beliefs.""The Uttar Pradesh government strongly defended its directive requiring owners of eateries along the Kanwar Yatra route to display their names, in the Supreme Court. The state administration challenged the petitions contesting the order, arguing that it was given to facilitate a peaceful and orderly pilgrimage and prevent any accidental hurt to the religious feelings of Kanwariyas, in a submission made to the highest court on 25th July.The Yogi Adityanath administration stated, “It may be noted that the idea behind the directives is transparency and informed choice of the consumer/Kanwaria regarding the food they eat during the period of the Yatra, keeping in mind their religious sentiments so that they don’t, even accidentally, fall foul of their beliefs. Such situations would lead to flare-ups where lakhs and crores of people are walking barefoot carrying holy water.”The state government provided the Supreme Court with a comprehensive petition in which it noted that the order was issued in response to complaints from Kanwariyas regarding the confusion caused by the names of the eateries and shops. Moreover, the affidavit pointed out unequivocally that these instructions are not discriminatory because they apply to all food vendors along the Kanwar Yatra path, regardless of their ethnic or religious affiliation.It conveyed, “The directives are also aimed at ensuring public safety and order during the Kanwar Yatra, given the large number of participants and the potential for communal tensions, it is imperative to take preventive measures that ensure a peaceful and harmonious pilgrimage. Past incidents have shown that misunderstandings regarding the type of food being sold have led to tensions and disturbances. The directives are a proactive measure to avoid such situations.”The state government further stated that shops are “free to conduct their business as usual” and that the order has no restrictions on the selling of non-vegetarian food. The requirement to list the identities of owners is “just an extra precaution” to maintain openness and prevent any misunderstandings. The authorities also mentioned that Kanwariyas’ religious feelings could be harmed by even slight misconceptions about the type of food they are served and it could result in tense situations, particularly in a communally vulnerable region such as Muzaffarnagar. the state arrested, “It is imperative to take preventive measures that ensure a peaceful and harmonious pilgrimage.”Furthermore, the government has justified its orders by maintaining that they are in line with the fundamental responsibilities of citizenship as stated in Article 51A of the Constitution, which obliges all Indian citizens to foster unity and a sense of fraternity. The instructions promote peace, a sense of fraternity, and harmonious cohabitation by guaranteeing that the religious beliefs of the Kanwariyas be honoured.On 22nd July, the Uttar Pradesh government issued an order mandating that the names of the proprietors of eateries along the Kanwar Yatra route be displayed. The rule was put into effect following complaints from some Kanwariyas regarding confusion caused by store and eatery names. Pilgrims had reportedly voiced reservations about the food that was being served along the way, and the authorities acted to ensure a smooth experience for the pilgrims. However, the Supreme Court issued an interim ruling over the decree and stayed it until 26th July.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"26 July, 2024","Dehumanising bigotry, casteist slurs, and more: Instagram influencer’s jovial reel about her Brahmin community targeted with hateful posts",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/dehumanising-bigotry-casteist-slurs-more-instagram-influencers-jovial-reel-about-her-brahmin-community-targeted-hateful-posts/,"A benign video by a Brahmin Instagram influencer about her community was attacked with dehumanising bigotry, dangerous casteist slurs, and abuses, signifying the dangerous extent of reverse discrimination faced by Brahmins. Hatred against Brahmins in Maharashtra has historical and sociopolitical roots, shaped by a variety of events and movements. Furthermore, various reasons such as the caste hierarchy, the rise of the Dalit movement, reservation rules, and so on have only fueled the ongoing hatred.Added to that, Maharashtra politics has frequently been characterized as a struggle between Brahminical forces and the more powerful Maratha and OBC communities. Political parties and leaders have occasionally leveraged anti-Brahmin sentiments to bolster their vote bases among non-Brahmin groups.Though it appears that animosity for the Brahmin community has decreased as people are seen living together in communities, hatred continues to spread via a new tool, social media. Several non-Brahmanical community people are seen targeting the Brahmins over social media platforms as they question the activities of the lower communities or try to regain their respectful position in society. In February this year, a Marathi Cinema actress who belongs to the Brahmin community, Ketaki Chitale was booked by the state police for demanding an impartial assessment of all cases registered under the SC/ST Act in the past 5 years. She had claimed that filing false cases under the SC/ST Act had become a racket and sought a probe into all such cases filed in the past 5 years. Also, she was arrested in May 2022 for a Facebook post where she had shared a verse, allegedly written on Sharad Pawar, calling him a person who hates Brahmins.In a similar case, hatred is now being spread against a Marathi influencer who posted a jovial video on Instagram praising the Brahmin community and describing their usual societal habits. The innocent-looking girl identified as Mansi Kulkarni in the video can be seen talking about her community mentioning multiple diets, the Marathi alphabet, and wedding rituals performed in the Brahmin community. However, all she got in return was hate from the non-Brahmanical community who used abusive words for the community, especially the women.A post shared by ~Mansi (@mansi.kulkarni12)The video is making rounds on social media platforms with netizens expressing shock over the incident where the influencer is being abused and targeted for attempting to follow a social media trend where one is required to talk about one’s community. “I am just shocked at the amount of abuse this innocent is being subjected to. Brahmins are less than 2% why is this hate against them? Is it hate against Hinduism because Brahmins are the upholders of Hindu religion and traditions,” said one of the users. “70+ years of anti-Brahmin agenda, Brahmins have been targeted with a goal to destroy Hinduism. The irony is Brahmins were not rulers, they were not rich, they were not warriors and they are not high in numbers, still, they are accused of oppression, such bullshit argument probably doesn’t exist anywhere else in the world. Most of these jerks in the Hindu community are the ones who would not think twice about becoming a Muslim or a Christian,” another user said. The original video posted by Mansi Kulkarni (13.9k followers on Instagram) was posted on 10th April this year. In the caption, she also clarified that she had no intentions to hurt any religious community but made the video to highlight typical societal habits of the Brahmins. “This reel is made only to showcase a typical Brahmin’s behaviour and habits. I’m not trying to hurt anyone’s religious sentiments trying to create any kind of discrimination or trying to offend someone. Keeping that in mind I majorly targeted our food habits and some rituals that we follow,” she said. The video has attracted more than 6 million views and 8900+ comments most of which are hateful. “Brahmins are looters, fraud, and cheaters,” comments one of the users. “Brahmins are casteists,” says another. “We are Mahar and we do (marry) Brahmin girls,” comments another non-Brahmanical individual. One another individual commented saying that Brahmins eat non-veg and then hide their faces. “They focus on donations,” “They do not have humanity,” “Marathas don’t like Brahmins,” etc such hateful comments got recognition. One of the users also indicated that Brahmin girls should be raped. Athawle says ""I put my thing in your (Brahmin) girls, What about that? "" pic.twitter.com/6b4HptkmbJFor the past 200 years, Maharashtra has been a torch-bearer region in the social renaissance of the country. Activists like Jyotirao Phule, Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj, and Dr BR Ambedkar are often glorified here as a stepwise legacy of social reforms mainly revolving around fighting caste discrimination and gender discrimination. The root causes of these social problems are often attributed to Hindu Dharmik beliefs.Brahmins, by virtue of their heredity and the definition of their caste, are known for being the traditional custodians of Dharmik know-how and are held responsible for the entire chaos, with the onus being immune to time and space. The post-renaissance Brahmins have further constantly become vulnerable to public violence for no cause while adhering to the progressive movement’s moral compass.It is crucial to note that the hatred against the Brahmins began long back in history. Most of the Chitpavan Brahmins were targeted in the year 1948 after MK Gandhi was shot dead by Nathuram Godse – a Chitpavan Brahmin. The Congress leaders also allegedly took part in the violence against the Brahmins to keep their positions secured in the then cabinet. The local politics then continued to propel the narrative of a ‘progressive Maharashtra’ led by the ideals of ‘Shahu-Phule-Ambedkar’ while leaving no space for leaders from the Brahmin community. Many Brahmins in the past migrated to the cities after several families succumbed to threats during the 1960s. The practice eliminated many Brahmin social reformers and thinkers from Marathi social discourse. Lok Hitwadi Gopal Hari Deshmukh is forgotten since he belongs to the Brahmin community. Despite his thought-provoking writing on social changes, Gopal Ganesh Agarkar has been comfortably overlooked. Lokmanya Tilak, formerly seen as the embodiment of Indian rebellion against British rule and a mass leader across caste lines, is now feared to be reduced to the status of another Brahmin political figure. Defaming Veer Savarkar and getting away with it is not uncommon in the Marathi state either.The state’s left-leaning and Islamophobic progressive liberal seculars depict these Marathi heroes as Brahmin-limited individuals on purpose. The idea behind this is that Hinduism is the underlying source of social evil, and Brahmins are depicted as its representatives, while others who have followed the same Dharma for millennia are given an alternate past in which they fight each other inside Hinduism.Even now, as a minority community, Maharashtrian Brahmins have little influence over the state’s politics, which are dominated by the Marathas and Kunbis. Even today, they are targeted, whether in politics, education, or societal standards that disrupt peace and tranquility. Addressing and eradicating hatred against any community, including Brahmins in Maharashtra, requires a multifaceted approach that includes education, debate, legislative changes, and community involvement. However, with the state granting caste-based benefits and reservations in the name of upliftment for lower-income populations, Brahmins are still disregarded and attacked for belonging to an independent caste that upholds Hinduism.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"26 July, 2024","Left and its delusion: Democrats debate whether ‘coconut’ for Kamala Harris is racist, Desis whine over ‘Lotus for Potus’ slogan alleging BJP connection",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/kamala-harris-coconut-lotus-for-potus-slogan-leftist-democrats-find-bjp-connection-contorversy-explained/,"The ongoing debate over 'coconut' and 'Lotus' reference for Kamala Harris goes on to show how leftist hysteria and mental gymnastics know no bounds.Days after incumbent US President Joe Biden endorsed Kamala Harris as the Democratic Presidential candidate, party supporters on social media are divided over the electoral campaign in the run-up to the Presidential race. The ongoing debate between Democrats has been over the rechristening of Kamala Harris as ‘Lotus’ and ‘coconut tree’. For the unversed, the first name of the potential Democratic Presidential nominee translates to ‘Lotus (Kamala)’ in Sanskrit. As such, it makes sense why a section of Democrats wants ‘Lotus for POTUS’. Another group of Democrats are referring to Kamala Harris as a ‘coconut tree’ and designing social media campaigns along those lines.There’s a battle going on between coconut trees & the lotus among “South Asian” wala’s and the lotus is taking some hits…even though it’s literally what Kamala means…lol! pic.twitter.com/VDWKheLkA0Interestingly, the reference to Kamala Harris as a ‘coconut tree’ is not due to her South Indian ancestry. It has something to do with her May 2023 speech during the swearing-in ceremony of Commissioners for the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for Hispanics.During her address, Kamala Harris was heard saying, “My mother used to — she would give us a hard time sometimes, and she would say to us, “I don’t know what’s wrong with you young people.  You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?” (Laughs).”Kamala Harris: ""My mother used to give us a hard time sometimes and she would say to us, 'I don't know what's wrong with you young people. You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?' Ha ha ha ha."" pic.twitter.com/aGMFCGgKt6Since then, Kamala Harris has been synonymous with ‘coconut trees’ in political spheres. Now, some Democrats and their supporters have taken offence to the use of ‘coconut’ to refer to the potential Presidential candidate.“If we’re keeping it buck, coconut is a slur (calling a South Asian person coconut is akin to calling a Black person oreo)— so maybe while we’re in the initial stages of this excitement, folks can swap out the coconuts for a lotus since Kamala means lotus in Sanskrit,” wrote one Imani Gandy.If we're keeping it buck, coconut is a slur (calling a South Asian person coconut is akin to calling a Black person oreo)—so maybe while we're in the initial stages of this excitement, folks can swap out the coconuts for a lotus since Kamala means lotus in Sanskrit. 🪷“It doesn’t surprise me to see so many white progressives putting a coconut emoji in their bios now as a racist slur against VP Harris (“ fell out of a coconut tree”), it doesn’t surprise me, but it still makes me sick to my stomach,” claimed another Democratic Party supporter.It doesn’t surprise me to see so many white progressives putting a coconut emoji in their bios now as a racist slur against VP Harris (“ fell out of a coconut tree”), it doesn’t surprise me, but it still makes me sick to my stomach.Another Democrat alleged that the coconut emoji used about Kamala Harris was a ‘slur’ and insisted on the use of the term ‘Lotus’.@RealLyndaCarter please consider replacing that problematic coconut 🥥 in your profile with a lotus 🪷.

We’re using a lotus 🪷since the name Kamala means lotus flower. 💯 #LotusForPOTUS https://t.co/sO7gLQiRxm pic.twitter.com/idC7uOijSdOne Ryan tweeted, “Now they mad about the coconut emoji and claiming it’s a racial slur against Kamala Harris like it ain’t just a reference to a quote said by her…”now they mad about the coconut emoji and claiming it’s a racial slur against kamala harris like it ain’t just a reference to a quote said by her… pic.twitter.com/ADQgatIsQ7While one set of deranged leftists was busy categorising ‘coconut’ as a slur, Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) and Indian fans of Kamala Harris found a new topic for outrage. According to them, the use of the term ‘ Lotus for Kamala’ is worse, given the association of the flower with the Narendra Modi-led-BJP. For the unversed, the lotus is the election symbol of the Bhartiya Janata Party.“Nah, Kamala literally means Lotus in Sanskrit/Hindi so that connection is fine (eg. LOTUS for POTUS). But the symbol itself is hella problematic bc it stands for the extreme RW hindu nationalist party BJP in India, so avoid the emoji,” one Poushali BhaduryNah, Kamala literally means Lotus in Sanskrit/Hindi so that connection is fine (eg. LOTUS for POTUS). But the symbol itself is hella problematic bc it stands for the extreme RW hindu nationalist party BJP in India, so avoid the emoji.One X user tweeted, “The bitter irony is that Imani has directed ignorant Kamala supporters to use the lotus emoji when that really would cause issues because she’s of Indian descent and in India, the lotus is a symbol of Hindu nationalist fascism under Modi’s BJP.” He was seen using the ‘coconut emoji’ in his profile name.The bitter irony is that Imani has directed ignorant Kamala supporters to use the lotus emoji when that really would cause issues because she's of Indian descent and in India, the lotus is a symbol of Hindu nationalist fascism under Modi's BJP.“Coconut is a joke not a slur for South Asians.

"26 July, 2024","‘Agnipath is a necessary reform, we need to keep the Army young and fit’: PM Modi in Ladakh on Kargil Vijay Diwas",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/agnipath-is-a-necessary-reform-we-need-pm-modi-in-ladakh-on-kargil-vijay-diwas/,"PM Modi said that the average age of soldiers in India being higher than the global average was a concern raised over the years and Agnipath resolved the matter.Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasised the Agnipath scheme during his address in Ladakh’s Kargil on Friday on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of Kargil Vijay Diwas.Highlighting the scheme, PM Modi said that the goal of Agnipath was to make the Army young and keep the Army continuously fit for war. He said that the major reforms in the army have been a long-standing demand.“The country has felt the need for major reforms in the defence sector for decades. The army has been demanding this for years, but unfortunately, it was not given enough importance earlier. The Agnipath scheme is also an example of the necessary reforms done in the Army. For decades, discussions have been going on in Parliament and many committees on making the army young,” PM Modi said during his address.“Those who are misleading the youth of the country. Their history is proof that they don’t care about soldiers. These are the same people who lied on OROP by showing a meagre amount of Rs 500 crore. It is our government that implemented the charges. More than Rs 1.25 lakh crore was given to ex-servicemen,” the PM added.PM Modi said that the average age of soldiers in India being higher than the global average was a concern raised over the years and Agnipath resolved the matter.“The average age of Indian soldiers being more than the global average has been a cause of concern. That is why this issue has also been raised in many committees for years. However, the will to solve this challenge related to the security of the country was not shown earlier. The country has addressed this concern through the Agneepath scheme,” he said.“Some people used to think that the Army means saluting politicians, doing parades but for us, the Army means the faith of 140 crore countrymen. The goal of Agneepath is to make the army young. The goal of Agneepath is to keep the army continuously fit for war,” PM Modi added.The Prime Minister also criticised the opposition parties opposing the scheme for “politicising” a “sensitive issue related to national security.”“Unfortunately, some people have made such a sensitive issue related to national security a subject of politics. Some people are doing politics of lies for their benefit, even on this reform of the army. These are the same people who weakened our army by committing scams worth thousands of crores in the army, who wanted the Air Force to never get modern fighter jets, who had made preparations to scrap the Tejas fighter plane,” PM Modi said.PM Modi further emphasised the reforms made in the defence sector during the last 10 years and said, “In the last 10 years, we have made defence reforms a top priority in the defence sector. Due to these reforms, our armies are now more capable and becoming self-reliant!”“Today, a significant share of defence procurement is being given to the Indian defence industry. Additionally, 25 per cent of the research and development budget in defence has been reserved for the private sector. As a result of these steps, India’s defence production has now exceeded Rs. 1.25 lakh crore,” he said.Earlier, PM Modi virtually carried out the first blast of the Shinkun La Tunnel project in Ladakh’s Kargil.The Shinkun La Tunnel Project consists of a 4.1-kilometre-long twin-tube tunnel that will be constructed at an altitude of around 15,800 feet on the Nimu-Padum-Darcha Road to provide all-weather connectivity to Leh, according to a PMO release. Once completed, it will be the highest tunnel in the world. Shinkun La tunnel will not only ensure swift and efficient movement of our armed forces and equipment but also foster economic and social development in Ladakh.Prime Minister Narendra Modi also paid tribute to bravehearts who made the supreme sacrifice in the line of duty in the 1999 Kargil War. The Prime Minister laid a wreath at the Kargil War Memoria in Drass, Ladakh, on the occasion of the 25th Kargil Vijay Diwas.Kargil Vijay Diwas, observed annually on July 26, commemorates the success of Operation Vijay in 1999.During this operation, Indian forces successfully reclaimed strategic positions in the Kargil sector of Jammu and Kashmir that had been infiltrated by Pakistani soldiers and terrorists. (This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

"26 July, 2024","Planned carnage, foreign intervention and a hidden Islamist nexus: Real objective behind violence in Bangladesh under the garb of ‘quota protests’",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/violence-in-bangladesh-real-motive-revealed-behind-quota-protests/,"For journalists in particular, those four days without the Internet were terrible, as we were cut-off from the rest of the world. While the entire world knew Bangladesh was witnessing protests by students demanding reform in quota-system in government jobs, in reality, thousands of members of Al Qaeda connected Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), ultra-Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) alongside their armed cadres and Pakistani ISI-trained terrorists were continuing total mayhem targeting public-private properties, key-point installations, police stations, prisons, members of law enforcement agencies and unarmed civilians. At the very first hour of this unimaginable cruelty, BNP-Jamaat cadres, along with their Islamist-jihadist cohorts set fire to Bangladesh Television (BTV) – state-owned television station, vandalised and looted valuable equipment, and obstructed fire service from extinguishing fire. They also physically assaulted staff members of this key-point installation. Almost simultaneously, hundreds of BNP-Jamaat cadres ransacked and vandalized the national data center, destroyed fiber optic connections and set fire to the entire building resulting in the collapse of Internet services throughout the country. Later it was revealed, that BNP-Jamaat wanted first to cut off Bangladesh from the rest of the world and then by capturing BTV – proclaim the ouster of the Sheikh Hasina government and announce the establishment of Sharia rule in the country.During interrogation, several cadres of BNP and Jamaat told law enforcement agencies that the entire mayhem was directly controlled and coordinated by BNP’s acting chairman and convicted terrorist Tarique Rahman, who has been living in London since 2007. Preparations for implementing the blueprint of unseating the government, assassinating Sheikh Hasina and turning Bangladesh into a Sharia nation began immediately after the January 7, 2024 general elections, which was boycotted by BNP.It was also revealed, BNP entered into an agreement with Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus for making him president by turning Bangladesh into “Islamic Republic of Bangladesh”. In return, Yunus pledged to get support of the Biden administration towards the “Islamic Republic of Bangladesh”, by using the influence of Bill and Hillary Clinton as well as several influential figures in the Democratic Party.Meanwhile, Tarique Rahman sought Pakistan’s spy agency Inter-Service Intelligence (ISI) in “unseating India’s puppet regime” in Bangladesh. He also promised Islamabad to cancel the recently signed agreement between Dhaka and New Delhi through which India shall use Bangladesh land for rail and road transit to connect the rest of the country with its northeastern regions.During the mayhem of the Islamist-terrorist nexus, which began on July 18 public and private properties worth billions of dollars have been rampaged and set on fire, BNP-Jamaat nexus as well as its Islamist and jihadist cohorts brutally murdered several members of Bangladesh Police as well as Rapid Action Battalion (RAB). Their cruelty was so intense that dead bodies of the members of law enforcement agencies were hung on flyovers in Dhaka as well as other parts of the country.It was such a horrific situation that cannot be described in words.Meanwhile, Islamists and militants attacked Narsingdi Jail – at the eastern part of the country, killed prison guards, looted weapons and ammunition and released 834 convicted prisoners, including 6 members of Ansar Al Islam – a local franchise of Al Qaeda. According to media reports, attackers looted 56 Chinese rifles, 19 shotguns and over 8,500 rounds of ammunition. Until now, over 770 convicted prisoners, including 7 members of Ansar Al Islam and 2 members of Jamaatul Mujahedin Bangladesh (JMB) are at large. It is anticipated, these jihadists may try to enter India by crossing the border as Ansar Al Islam has several secret camps and bases in West Bengal. It may be mentioned here that these militancy outfits are connected to Al Qaeda and Islamic State respectively.In other prisons in Bangladesh, various militancy outfits including Ansar Al Islam, Jamaatul Mujahedin Bangladesh (JMB) and Harkat-ul-Jihad (HuJI) were preparing for this gruesome terrorist act for months, while despite the publication of reports in the media, prison authorities did not take any measures against such dangerous activities.Taking advantage of internet outage, members and activists of Al Qaeda-connected Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI), Hizbut Tahrir and jihadist forces in several countries, including the United States, Britain, EU nations, Malaysia, and Middle East began spreading disinformation on social media with the ulterior motive of misleading Bangladesh expatriates as well as international communities. To give credibility to such gruesome propaganda and disinformation drive, culprits also circulated photoshopped or doctored photographs of front-pages of local dailies with concocted information, thus generating confusion and fear within Bangladesh expatriates and others.Meanwhile, according to several credible sources, at least 350 well-trained terrorists entered Bangladesh during the holiday of Eid Ul Adha with the target of joining subversive and terrorist acts throughout Bangladesh, which they codenamed ‘Bangla Spring’. These terrorists were secretly trained by Pakistani spy agency Inter-Service Intelligence (ISI) within various training camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). A significant portion of these trained terrorists belong to Stranded Pakistani Biharis in Bangladesh, who were sent to Pakistan for training under the supervision of BNP and Jamaat.The source further said, some of these terrorists are given special commando training while there also are experts on making explosives. It said, at least one dozen Stranded Pakistani Biharis in Bangladesh are suicide attackers.Another source said, from the first week of June, under the direct instructions of convicted terrorist and acting chairman of Al Qaeda-connected Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), leaders of this party, including members of it executive and advisory committee donated BDT 1.5 million to 50 million each in the “special fund” for “implementing anti-government movement” and “unseating Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina”. Party’s jailed chairperson Khaleda Zia’s former press secretary has been working as coordinator of this fund collection while collected funds were handed over to a BNP leader, who owns a private television channel. While receiving donations from party leaders through Khaleda Zia’s press secretary, the owner of the private television alone has donated over BDT 150 million. He also arranged temporary shelter for the ISI-trained terrorists in different parts of the country.According to the source, alongside BNP and Jamaat, members, trained armed cadres of outlawed militancy outfit Hizbut Tahrir took part in destructive and terrorist activities throughout the country since July 17, while hundreds of its activists began massive propaganda through social media platforms, especially Meta (formerly known as Facebook) and ‘X’.It said, in London and New York City, dozens of BNP members also joined online propaganda by spreading disinformation and instigative contents. A very large number of the members of Dhaka’s entertainment industry, including those who have received numerous types of benefits from the Awami League government during the past fifteen years also joined online propaganda against ruling Awami League and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and circulated extremely offensive posts as well as images and video contents of social media.Meanwhile sitting in prison, a death-row prisoner and senior officer of Bangladesh Army started communicating with several officers by using encrypted communication apps and circulated provocative materials with the call for “sepoy-officer revolt” against Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Awami League government.As Bangladesh successfully fought and foiled this Islamist blueprint of turning the country into a neo-Taliban state, with active participation of the members of law enforcement agencies alongside Bangladesh Army, the defeated Islamist nexus has now mobilized a large number of cyberterrorists, including David Bergman, Shahidul Alam, Tasneem Khalil, Lt Col (sacked) Shahid Uddin Khan, Pinaki Bhattacharya,  Zulkarnain Saer Khan Sami and others in spreading vile propaganda alongside doctored images and deepfake videos on social media with the ulterior agenda of mislead international community, including media outlets.For journalists in particular, those four days without the Internet were terrible, as we were cut-off from the rest of the world. Even after the resumption of the internet on July 24, the speed is extremely slow – much-slower than 2G, while using communications apps such as WhatsApp, Telegram etcetera are almost non-functional. Government has imposed a temporary suspension of Facebook and TikTok, as vested interest groups mainly use these platforms in spreading disinformation, fake news as well as disturbing propaganda stuff. For the Bangladesh government, one of the biggest challenges is fighting disinformation and fake news alongside rumours on social media as well as a section of Western media outlets. Such propaganda campaigns on social media and Western media are clearly aimed at tarnishing the image of Bangladesh as well as putting the ruling Awami League government and the country’s law enforcement agencies and Armed Forces into trouble. Although the Awami League government has succeeded in foiling the recent attempts of the BNP-Jamaat nexus to capture power by unseating Sheikh Hasina, the coming days may bear much harder challenges as BNP-Jamaat is adamantly looking to return to power.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"25 July, 2024","Congress party distances itself from party MP and former Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi’s support to Khalistani MP Amripal Singh in Lok Sabha, says...",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/congress-party-distances-itself-from-its-mp-charanjit-singh-channis-support-to-khalistani-mp-amripal-singh-in-lok-sabha/,"Former Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi attacked the union govt in parliament for keeping Waris Punjab De chief and Khadoor Sahib Lok Sabha MP Amritpal Singh in jail. The Congress party has said that the comments made by party MP Charanjit Singh Channi in support of Khalistani MP Amirtpal Singh are his own and he does not represent the party’s views. Congress General Secretary in-charge Communications Jairam Ramesh posted a tweet distancing the party from Channi’s comments.“The views expressed by Charanjit Singh Channi, MP on Amritpal Singh are his own, and do not reflect in any way the position of the Indian National Congress,” Jairam Ramesh posted on X (Twitter).This comes after the former Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi attacked the union govt in parliament for keeping Waris Punjab De chief and Khadoor Sahib Lok Sabha MP Amritpal Singh in jail. Channi alleged that there is “undeclared emergency” under the Modi govt and claimed that “free speech” of the Khalistani leader was being curbed.Speaking during the debate on the Budget 2024, Charanjit Singh Channi said, “They (BJP) speak about Emergency every day. But what about the undeclared Emergency in the country today?…This too is Emergency that a man who was elected as an MP by 20 lakh people in Punjab is behind bars under the NSA. He is unable to present the views of the people of his constituency, here. This too is Emergency.”He alleged that there is an undeclared emergency in the nation while stating that Sidhu Moose Wala, one of the famous singers of the nation was killed and justice has not delivered to his family. Channi said, “Today in the country, a financial emergency-like condition is emerging and the BJP is responsible for that. They talk about the 1975 emergency but about today’s undeclared emergency in the country? It is also an emergency that Sidhu Moose Wala, one of the famous singers of the nation was killed and justice has not given to his family.”Notably, while Channi blamed the NDA govt at centre for Amritpal Singh’s arrest, the fact is Singh was arrested by Punjab Police and the NSA has been slapped against him by the Punjab govt run by AAP. Last month, the AAP govt in Punjab extended detention of Amritpal Singh and his nine aides, currently lodged in Dibrugarh Jail in Assam, by a year under the stringent National Security Act (NSA).The order was issued by Punjab government’s home affairs and justice department on 3rd June. Therefore, it is the Congress ally AAP govt which is keeping Amritpal Singh in jail, not the Modi govt at centre.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

He turned politician and then started his cartel to sell drugs. He earned 30 Billion Dollars at that time, now it’s 90 Billion Dollars’ worth. He was arrested in 1976 and in 1980 he became the number one richest drug lord in the world.”“One can become richer by selling drugs as well. What was the aim of former Chief Minister (YS Jagan)?” He further said, “Tata, Reliance, and Ambani have money and he aspired to become richer than them.

"25 July, 2024",Bungalow No 1: Centre allocates Lutyens bungalow to AAP for its office after the party was asked to vacate its office on court land,https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/centre-allocates-lutyens-bungalow-to-aap-for-its-office-on-delhi-hc-order/,"The Aam Aadmi Party has been asked to vacate current office on Deen Dayal Marg as the office is situated on land allocated to Rouse Avenue CourtThe Central Government has allotted a new office space to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), following the orders of the Delhi High Court. Bungalow No. 1, Ravi Shankar Shukla Lane, New Delhi will be the new address of the Aam Aadmi Party headquarters. The house has been allocated to the party on a temporary basis for 3 years, while the govt finds land to be given to the party for the construction of permanent office. The urgent decision came after the Delhi HC set a time limit for the same, as the AAP has to vacate its current office on the Supreme Court’s orders.On July 16, the Delhi HC granted 10 days to the Centre to decide the request of AAP for temporary allotment of land for office space. The Center had sought four weeks to decide on the request of AAP, but the court granted only 10 days.Advocate Rishikesh Kumar representing AAP, said that the High Court had passed a judgement supporting them on June, 5 and said that the place must be allotted to AAP. He said that the party will see the suitability and other factors for the allocated house, adding that the party has time till 10 August to vacate its present office premises at Rouse Avenue.Notably, AAP wanted a place for its office on the Deen Dayal Marg, where its current office apart from the offices of BJP and Congress is located. But no place was available to be allocated to the party, and now the govt has allocated a Lutyens Bungalow instead.AAP is entitled to 1,000 square metres of land for its party headquarters given its national party status.“On 5th June, the High Court had given a judgment in our favour and said that the place should be allotted to Aam Aadmi Party. There was a time limit of 6 weeks which expired on 17th July. On 16th July, the Union govt asked for more time. The court rejected their application and asked the Union for allotment by the 25th of July,” said Advocate Rishikesh Kumar.“The union while complying with the court’s directions has offered us an allotment. The Party team is examining the place and after that, we will decide on further course of action…” he added.AAP had moved the High Court seeking allotment of space to use as its party office till the permanent allotment of land for the construction of its office. The High Court had said that the Aam Aadmi Party is entitled to use a housing unit as its party office till the permanent allotment of land for the construction of its office.The court had cited Consolidated guidelines for allotment of GPRA to Political parties which says that the National Political Parties, recognised by the Election Commission of India, shall be allowed to retain/secure allotment of one housing unit from General Pool in Delhi for their office use on payment of the normal licence fee. The said accommodation will be provided for a period of three years during which the party would acquire a plot of land in an institutional area and will construct its own accommodation for the party office, the guidelines add.The High Court said that a perusal of the said clause indicates that National Political Parties have a right to retain/secure allotment of one housing unit from GeneralPool in Delhi for their office use on payment of licence fee and the said accommodation will be provided for a period of three years during which the party would acquire a plot of land in an institutional area and will construct its own accommodation for party office.The Delhi High Court added that even though always there is pressure on the Pool of houses available for allotment to the officers, it can’t be the reason to deny the right to a house to use as its party office. However, the high court said that whether the Petitioner would be entitled to a plot of land in Central Delhi or not is the subject matter of another Writ Petition.The Aam Aadmi Party has been asked to vacate current office on Deen Dayal Marg as the office is situated on land allocated to Rouse Avenue Court. The Supreme Court in March this year slammed AAP over alleged ‘encroachment’ of land meant for Delhi judiciary, and asked it to vacate the premises by 15 June. Slamming Aam Aadmi Party for ‘illegally occupying’ the encroached land, the three-judge SC bench emphasised that AAP has no lawful right to continue occupying the allotted land.However, the apex court had allowed the party to use the office till the Lok Sabha elections. The party had agreed to vacate the office, on the condition that it be given an alternate location as per its entitlement given its national party status.The party had denied encroachment charges saying that the office was allocated to it in 2015 by the AAP govt in Delhi. However, the Land and Development Office (L&DO) under the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry allocated the land for the expansion of the District court complex, and the party was asked to move out.Before the allocation of the Rouse Avenue house, AAP operated its office from rented premises.Speaking to the media, Delhi Minister and AAP leader Saurabh Bharadwaj, “…Attempts were being made to oust AAP from its office and push it onto streets, that it be trampled on and finished. This is a common courtesy in politics that you allot an office to a party. Unfortunately, we have to approach the Court even for this. We welcome that with the Court’s repeated directions, the Centre was compelled to allot an office to AAP. But it’s unfortunate and they should have allotted the office before we moved the court.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"25 July, 2024","India strongly takes up Hindu Temple vandalisation issue with Canadian authorities, expects swift action",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/india-strongly-takes-up-temple-vandalisation-issue-with-canadian-authorities/,"Canadian law enforcement agencies have been urged to take proactive measures to address these threats and ensure the safety and security of all religious communities in Canada.India condemned the vandalisation of temple in Edmonton and strongly taken up the matter with Canadian authorities in Delhi and Ottawa, Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) official spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said on Thursday.Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said on Thursday that India has strongly taken up the vandalisation of temple in Edmonton with Canadian authorities in Delhi and Ottawa, adding that India expects Canada to take swift action.Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) official spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said that India expects the local authorities to take strong action against those behind the act.Asked about India’s response on temple vandalization in Edmonton, Jaiswal stated, “We have strongly taken up the matter with Canadian authorities, both here in Delhi and in Ottawa. We condemn the vandalization. We expect the local authorities to take swift and strong action against those responsible.”“These attacks against temples have become a recurring occurrence and are done with a purpose which is not very difficult to fathom. We have seen a number of such incidents in recent times in Canada. Lack of action against the perpetrators has further emboldened such criminal elements. Those advocating and responsible for extremism and violence need to be brought to justice, or else the rule of law and respect for pluralism in Canada will continue to be severely undermined,” he said while addressing a weekly media briefing.Jaiswal’s remarks come after the BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir in Edmonton was vandalised. Canada’s Member of Parliament for Nepean, Chandra Arya, voiced deep concern over the escalating incidents of hate-fueled violence directed at Hindu-Canadian communities.“The Hindu temple BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir in Edmonton is vandalised again. During the last few years, Hindu temples in the Greater Toronto Area, British Columbia, and other places in Canada are being vandalised with hateful graffiti,” Arya said in a post on X on Tuesday.The recent attack adds to a string of similar incidents documented in recent years, underscoring a distressing trend of religious intolerance. Last year, a Hindu temple in Windsor suffered defacement with anti-India graffiti, sparking widespread condemnation and calls for action from both Canadian and Indian officials. Earlier incidents in Mississauga and Brampton saw temples similarly targeted, drawing strong reactions from the Indian community in Canada.Arya, a Liberal member of Parliament known for his advocacy on multicultural issues, pointed to the impunity enjoyed by Khalistani extremists in Canada, citing instances where their rhetoric has openly incited hatred and violence.“As I have always been saying, Khalistani extremists seem to get away with ease with their public rhetoric of hate and violence. Again, let me put it on record. Hindu Canadians are legitimately concerned. Like a broken record, I again call on Canadian law enforcement agencies to take this issue seriously before these rhetorics get translated into physical action against Hindu Canadians,” Arya reiterated.“Gurpatwant Singh Pannun of Sikhs for Justice last year publicly called for Hindus to go back to India. Khalistan supporters publicly celebrated in Brampton and Vancouver the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and brandishing images of deadly weapons,” Arya further said.The incident was also raised on social media by another Canadian political leader, who termed the incident a display of “hateful rhetoric”.Earlier today, the Edmonton BAPS Mandir was vandalised with paint, displaying hateful rhetoric on the walls of what should be a place of refuge. Hate has no part in Canada – much less in places of worship & prayer. This incident is wrong & goes against the values of our city,” Randy Boissonnault, Member of the House of Commons of Canada, said in a post on Tuesday on X.Canadian law enforcement agencies have been urged to take proactive measures to address these threats and ensure the safety and security of all religious communities in Canada. The incidents have prompted renewed discussions on bolstering security measures around Hindu temples and enhancing efforts to combat extremist propaganda. (This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

The matter is being investigated,"" informed Guna Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Mansingh Thakur. Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) members protested at Vandana Convent School in Madhya Pradesh’s Guna, after the Principal Catherine Vattoly stopped sixth-grade students from chanting Sanskrit verses during the morning assembly on 15th July. A First Information Report (FIR) was registered against her, per the authorities. The institution is one of the district’s oldest English medium schools and was founded in 1974 by the Sisters of the St. Elizabeth.Saksham Dubey, a 26-year-old Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) activist filed the formal complaint which stated three students attempted to recite the Sanskrit shloka (verse) “Sarve Bhavantu Sukhina” on 15th July between 8 am to 9 am when Principal Catherine got upset and snatched the microphone from the students and stopped them from giving the speech.The complaint highlighted, “Sister Catherine said all this Shayari (poetry) will not be allowed and asked the students to speak in English. The statement of Sister Catherine equating shokla to Shayari has hurt our Hindu religious sentiments. The students have to also face mental harassment. The seeds of missionary mentality were sown by Sister Catherine, which affected all the students following the Hindu religion.”#WATCH | #Guna: Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) Workers Stage Protest At Vandana Convent School After Principal Halts Sixth-Grade Student From Chanting Sanskrit Verses During Morning Assembly#MadhyaPradesh #MPNews #Students #ABVP pic.twitter.com/XVqRfDZq0RCatherine Vattoly, who was holding a microphone, addressed the demonstrators and apologised in the hope that they would leave after ABVP activists staged a protest at the school gates. “It was a day to speak in English, so the student was stopped. If anyone’s feelings were hurt, I apologise. I respect all religions,” she claimed. The agitation commenced after ABVP members read in a Hindi newspaper that the Principal took away the mic from the students and pushed them to speak in English.On July 21, District Education Officer (DEO) Chandrashekhar Sisodia sent a show-cause notice to the institution which asked the management to clarify. The notice highlighted, “What kind of program was conducted in your school in which the children were snatched from the microphone and stopped from speaking Sanskrit verses and Hindi, and were asked to speak in English.”It further stated, “In the above sequence, you should immediately provide your explanation along with evidence in writing to the undersigned. If the explanation is not received or is not found satisfactory, a proposal for disciplinary action against the school as per rules will be sent to the competent authority.” The administration of the school alleged that selected pupils usually deliver presentations in Hindi and English during morning assembly. Speeches that day were expected to be given in English as per the school, but the students started speaking in Hindi. He was requested to speak in English by the teacher. Everyday prayers include the recitation of several religious quotes.The demonstrators demanded that the Principal be fired and that the Sanskrit verse that the youngster had been prevented from uttering be incorporated into the school’s daily prayers. They also wanted an FIR against the school administration. It took around two hours for the protest to end. After reassurances from the school authorities, the situation subsided when the district education officer arrived.“I also come from an English medium school. It is a global language and in South Indian states this is the language that is used. I also speak in English. We did not have an issue with the language. The school Principal is denying freedom to these children. We wanted to bring these anti-national practices to the administration’s notice,” said ABVP district convener Piyush Mishra.“After the uproar and protest by the student organisation, the police took cognisance of the matter and registered an FIR against the school Principal. The matter is being investigated,” informed Guna Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Mansingh Thakur. The official complaint was filed under sections 299 (Deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious sentiments of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) and 196 (Promoting animosity between different groups on grounds of religion, etc.) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS). These sections provide for a maximum sentence of three years for the convicted individuals.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"25 July, 2024",Uttar Pradesh: Bulldozers raze down decades old illegal flower market in Lucknow- Details,https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/uttar-pradesh-bulldozer-action-flower-market/,"The land on which the flower marker was being operated belonged to Hussainabad Trust who had leased the land on 100 years lease.On Thursday, 25th July, the Uttar Pradesh government invoked bulldozer action demolishing the illegal flower market set up in the city of Lucknow since 2001. The land on which the flower marker was being operated belonged to Hussainabad Trust who had leased the land on 100 years lease. The state in the year 2024 canceled the lease and ordered the shopkeepers to vacate the land. However, the state administration razed off the illegal structure. As per the local reports, the flower market has now been shifted to ‘Kisan Bazaar’ in the Gomati Nagar area of Lucknow.This bulldozer action executed by the state has affected more than 100 farmers who sold their flower supply in this particular flower market. It is believed that the flower market contributed to Rs 2-3 lakhs of trade on a daily basis. During the seasons of festivals or weddings, the trade exceeded Rs 10 lac daily in this market.लखनऊ की सबसे बड़ी फूल मंडी पर चला बुल्डोजर: प्रशासन ने नहीं मानी डिप्टी सीएम की बात; राम मंदिर के लिए फूल यहीं से गया था https://t.co/yWHuN9Jp5O pic.twitter.com/8EuyT3b6fIThe flower market earlier operated from the 2000 sq ft of land behind the Imambada area of the city. It was shifted to the Hussainabad Trust land in the year 2001. The administration is said to have issued notices to the farmers to shift their business to ‘Kisan Bazar’ but the farmers protested. With special efforts and cooperation of the district administration and police department, all types of flower trade in Chowk, Lucknow, then were transferred to Kisan Bazaar, Vibhuti Khand, Gomati Nagar, Lucknow in 2019. The District Magistrate in 2022 issued a letter to terminate the lease of the flower market and remove the encroachments. Further, in the year 2023, the Trust issued a notice asking the farmers to vacate the land.In the year 2024, the lease of the Hussainabad Trust was canceled and the farmers were issued notice again to vacate the land. The farmers again launched a protest. However, the state executed the bulldozer action demolishing the illegal structure in Lucknow. The Flower Market Welfare Committee had requested Deputy CM Brajesh Pathak to save the flower market. A month ago, the Committee’s people also went to meet him. However, the administration issued notices in June 2024 to vacate the illegal market instead. “If not complied with by 2:00 PM on 26-06-2024, the flower market and other illegal encroachments will be forcibly removed, and the entire expense will be recovered from them,” the notice read.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Our position is that State governments should not intrude into matters that are beyond their constitutional jurisdiction,” he added.The order by the Kerala government dated July 15, stated that the secretary (labour and skills) K Vasuki “will hold the additional charge of the matters connected with external cooperation.”It also mentioned that the Resident Commissioner at Kerala House in the national capital will be supporting Vasuki in matters concerning external cooperation and will liaise with the Ministry of External Affairs, Missions, and Embassies.This announcement attracted strong criticism from the Centre as well as the Bharatiya Janata Party.BJP State President K Surendran slammed the Pinarayi Vijayan-led Kerala government, saying that it is a “blatant overreach” and a violation of the Union List of the Constitution.“The appointment of an IAS officer as ‘Foreign Secretary’ in Kerala by CM Pinarayi Vijayan is a blatant overreach and a violation of the Union list of our Constitution. The LDF government has no mandate for foreign affairs. This unconstitutional move sets a dangerous precedent.

He further said the move was not meant to engage in diplomatic relations, which was under the central government’s jurisdiction.Congress MP Shashi Tharoor also reacted to the appointment and said that there was nothing unusual and that the appointment of the young officer was a focal point of responsibility within the government.  (This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

"25 July, 2024","CBI court finds 14 people including CPM leader guilty in 14-year-old murder case of Congress leader Anchal Ramabhadran in Kerala, 4 acquitted: Details",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/anchal-ramabhadran-murder-14-accused-including-cpm-leader-found-guilty/,"The testimony of his wife and two kids, who revealed that the perpetrators mercilessly and cruelly ended the life of Ramabhadran in front of them played a vital role in the caseFourteen individuals including Babu Panicker, a member of the CPM Kollam district committee, have been found guilty by a special CBI court in Thiruvananthapuram of killing 44-year-old Congress member Anchal Ramabhadran, at Yeroor in Anchal in 2010. The court will pronounce the sentence on 30th July. Meanwhile, four others including S Jayamohan, chairman of the Cashew Development Corporation and a member of the district secretariat, Riyaz, Markson Yesudas and Roykutty who were charged in the case were acquitted due to lack of evidence.CPM activists killed INTUC office bearer Ramabhadran on 10th April 2010, at approximately nine o’clock at night in his rented Yeroor home. Ramachandran was having a conversation with his kids in the kitchen when the accused burst into the residence. Ramabhadran attempted to flee the house upon witnessing them, however, they went after him and hacked him to death. Ramabhadran was taken to the hospital right away, but the next morning he passed away from his wounds. The testimony of his wife and two kids, who revealed that the perpetrators mercilessly and cruelly ended the life of Ramabhadran in front of them played a vital role in the case. They were deemed culpable under Sections 20 and 27 of the Arms Act as well as Sections 302, 120 (b), and 201 of the Indian Penal Code. The culprits were identified as Girishkumar, Padman, Afzal, Najmal, Shibu, Vimal, Sudheesh, Shan, Ratheesh, Biju, Ranjith, Sally alias Kochunni, Riaz alias Muneer, DYFI leader Riaz, Markson, former CPM Anchal Area Secretary PS Suman, CPM ex-District Committee member Babu Panicker, Jaimohan, Roykutty, and Ravindran. The murder trial started late. After Ramabhadran’s family petitioned the court, dissatisfied with the results of the initial inquiry conducted by the local police and the crime branch, the probe was turned over to the CBI. Initially, the local police detained sixteen CPM employees but Bindhu, the wife of Ramabhadran, filed a case with the High Court, asserting that the Left government’s inquiry was unfair which resulted in the CBI’s involvement.Ramabhadran was an INTUC local leader and the vice-president of the Congress for the Eroor seat. According to the CBI inquiry, Ramabhadran’s attempts to boost the Congress party’s popularity and recruit CPM members to the party were the reason behind the murder. The crime was the result of an altercation between the local Congress workers and the first accused, Girish, a CPM member. The murder was considered to have been caused by animosity over a fight that broke out during a temple celebration in the area, following which Ramabhadran assisted some of the people who had been jailed in obtaining bail, based on other reports.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"25 July, 2024","The world remembers Akhlaq, but not Tejram: Here is how Tejram was lynched in Bareilly by a Muslim mob over stopping them from playing...",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/tejram-lynching-in-bareilly-by-a-muslim-mob-on-muharram-up-police-buldozer-action-stone-pelting-firing/,"The media bias contributes to the perpetuation of a narrative wherein Muslims are permanent victims while Hindus are disregarded. Furthermore, it denies victims equal respect and justice because their cases do not receive the attention and advocacy that would help in getting justice for Hindu victims.On Muharram this year, several incidents of mob violence and raising of slogans like ‘Sar tan se juda’ or ‘Hindustan mein rehna hai to Allah hu Akbar kehna hai” have been reported in various parts of India. However, there was no “idea of India khatre mein hai” or “lynchistan” type outrage on the ground or on social media. Why? Because the victims were Hindus and the perpetrators were Islamists. In Uttar Pradesh’s Bareilly district, an incident of mob lynching has been reported wherein a Hindu youth named Tejram was brutally lynched by a Muslim mob on 18th July after Hindus objected to Muslims playing “dhol” outside a Hindu temple during a Muharram procession on 17th July in Gausganj area.An altercation ensued over Hindus stopping Muslims from playing Dhol [drums] in front of a Hindu temple on 17th July during the Muharram procession. The accused Muslims then started attacking the Hindus and pelting stones at their houses and harassing the women. The ruckus had continued even after the arrival of the police. The Muslims later called more people from Rampur, CB Ganj, Mirganj, Devarniya and other neighbouring areas and attacked Hindu houses on the night of Friday with stones, sticks and other things.During the attack on Hindus by accused Muslims on the night of July 18th, Tejram sustained severe injuries on the head. An IndiaToday report said that some 80-100 persons arrived in the Gausganj neighbourhood and began pelting stones, breaking into houses, vandalising them, and beating up the residents. The villagers said that the Muslim attackers dragged Tejram from his house to the mosque and brutally thrashed the 26-year-old youth. Tejram’s family has said that he was attempting to defuse the matter. The Hindu youth was rushed to the hospital, however, Shahi Police Station in-charge Amit Kumar said that the victim succumbed to his injuries during treatment. Subsequently, the deceased victim’s body was sent for postmortem examination.The postmortem report mentions the brutality inflicted by the attackers during the lynching of Tejram. The report said that the skull bones of victim Tejram were damaged during the mob lynching as a result of strikes from large stones and iron rods, and blood clots had developed in his brain. While Tejram was trying to escape, his both hands and shoulders bleeding.After the mob violence, a case was then filed by the Hindu community against 50 identified individuals and 15 unidentified individuals. The Police eventually began an investigation into the case and arrested around 35 persons including Afsar Ali, Imran, Mukhtiar Ali, Abdul, Salam, and others. When police tried to arrest some accused, the accused had opened fire on police personnel too. The police had to open retaliatory fire. This resulted in injury to one of the accused identified as Alamgir. After this incident, one Najakat Ali was also arrested by the police. A constable was injured by shrapnel in the firing.On Tuesday (23rd July), the district administration of Uttar Pradesh’s Bareilly razed over nine houses belonging to the Muslim accused in the case. Before this, the administration demolished 11 buildings belonging to the accused persons after finding that they constructed houses on Gram Samaj’s government land. During the demolition drive, the house of the main accused Bakhtawar was also razed to the ground. In addition, the illegal houses of accused Babu, Hasan Ali, Kader Ali, Hanif, Haseen, and Riyasat have also been marked for demolition.थाना शाही क्षेत्रान्तर्गत ग्राम गौसगंज में दिनांक 19.07.2024 को घटित घटना के सम्बन्ध में पंजीकृत अभियोगो में 35 अभियुक्तों की गिरफ्तार आदि की कार्यवाही होने के सम्बन्ध में पुलिस अधीक्षक दक्षिणी बरेली की बाइट।#UPPolice pic.twitter.com/BeJjVLJAvgDo you remember Akhlaq? Do you remember Pehlu Khan? Yes, you do! These names have been etched in your memory since the entire media, left-liberal ecosystem and political vultures made sure you do, and feel “ashamed as a Hindu” and guilty. A mere mention of these two names refreshes one’s memory of how the anti-Hindu cabal and placard gang berated Hindustan as “lynchistan” to assert that somehow the Muslim ‘minority’ is no longer safe under the Modi-led ‘Hindutva’ government.When incidences like the alleged lynching of Akhlaq in 2015 and cow smuggler Pehlu Khan occurred in 2017, there was massive criticism, media coverage, and outrage from a variety of sources, including liberals and self-proclaimed ‘human rights’ activists. Akhlaq’s lynching, in which he was suspected of storing beef, became a national issue, sparking debates about intolerance and mob violence in India against ‘minorities’ even as it turned out that while Akhlaq’s family had claimed the meat in question was mutton, the final report on the same confirmed it was from a cow. However, similar outrage and attention appear to be non-existent in the case of the lynching of Tejaram since he was a Hindu lynched by those belonging to an ‘oppressed’ minority. A man named Tabrez beaten to death in Jharkhand in 2019 over allegations of theft sparked more outrage than over a Hindu youth who spoke for his community being lynched by Muslims. While news anchors conducted primetime debates to peddle the ‘darr ka mahaul’ narrative, long op-eds were written by anti-Hindu pens for hire in Indian and Western media passing off incidents of violence over cattle smuggling allegations as the lynching of Muslims by ‘Hindutva’ mobs, there is deafening ‘secular’ silence over the horrific lynching of Tejaram in Bareilly. Except for a few journalists, the mainstream media which takes delight in preaching to Hindus how they are becoming ‘intolerant’, is absolutely mum over a Hindu man’s lynching by Muslims, and incidents involving the raising of murderous ‘Sar tan se juda’ slogans during Muharram processions. You will not see primetime debates with ‘experts’ discussing where the country is heading.If you have not heard about Teja Ram’s brutal lynching by Islamists on Moharram, I don’t blame you. “Secular silence”, as @AmanChopra_ puts it, is very real. Have a look at how the news is blacked out totally even by Google. pic.twitter.com/Zu7383W13oWhile Hindus have the least expectations from biased media publications, their silence on incidents of religiously motivated violence against Hindus is dangerous. Their silence contributes to the normalisation of anti-Hindu violence. If narrative building is an art, Islamists and their media allies are its Picasso. On the one hand, Islamists and Muslim ‘journalists’ stir outrage even by peddling fake ‘mob lynching by Hindus’ narrative over incidents wherein the deceased happens to be a Muslim with no communal angle whatsoever, on the other, incidents of violence against Hindus do not get enough attention forget outrage and even the media forgets such incidents after one or two short articles or mentioning them in ‘100 fatafat’ news on television.The media bias contributes to the perpetuation of a narrative wherein Muslims are permanent victims while Hindus are disregarded. Furthermore, it denies victims equal respect and justice because their cases do not receive the attention and advocacy that would help in getting justice for Hindu victims. Apparently, the biased media and Hindu-hating political parties have successfully established the narrative that there are two types of mob lynching: one is “communal lynching” wherein the victim happens to be a Muslim regardless of the existence of any communal angle or not, and the other is “secular lynching” wherein Hindus are the victims of mob violence by Muslims. They have managed to convince the public that somehow only alleged ‘communal lynching’ is worth street protests, candle marches, social media outrage, primetime debates, celebrities crying ‘Not my India’ etc. It seems that the incidents of anti-Hindu violence are being deliberately downplayed to convince the Hindus that only the Muslim ‘minority’ can be victims and since Hindus are the majority community they are by default the oppressors.Just imagine the outrage had Tejram’s name been Tabarez and it was the occasion of Ram Navami or Hanuman Jayanti instead of Muharram. Notably, in what seems like a deliberate cover-up, most mainstream media reports did not even mention that Tejaram was lynched allegedly inside a mosque. No wonder, the killers of Kamlesh Tiwari get bail while the deceased Hindu is forgotten while death anniversaries of cow smugglers and cow meat hoarders are observed by Islamists every year. The short-term memory of Hindus further helps them in downplaying anti-Hindu violence and whitewashing the crimes of Islamists as well as using the desperation of Hindus to hold moral high ground to guilt trip them over incidents wherein the deceased happens to be Muslim. Hindus are definitely losing the narrative battle despite being persecuted while Islamists, with the help of their media allies and politicians continue to control the narrative and even influence elections by playing perpetual victimhood. So far, the cases of grooming jihad [also called love jihad] are dismissed as ‘fiction’, ‘hoax’ and ‘conspiracy theory’, soon the cases of anti-Hindu violence will also be given similar tags.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"25 July, 2024",The regular Q&A drama between Pakistani journalist and US State Dept to lecture India is now peddling false claims of Muslim victimhood: How the...,https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/us-state-dept-pakistani-journalist-asks-questions-indias-internal-matters-kanwar-yatra-order-false-claims/,"Interestingly, Jahanzaib Ali deliberately made it sound like a Muslim-specific order and Miller didn't bother to rectify it, despite being obviously aware of the facts of the case. On 24th July (local time), US State Department Spokesperson, Matthew Miller responded to a question about the implementation of the directive of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand governments to put up names of owners and workers of shops, restaurants and carts on Kanwar Yatra marg and outside Ujjain Mahakal Temple. The question was asked by Pakistani journalist Jahanzaib Ali who is known for putting up questions making it easier for the US Government to meddle with India’s internal affairs. It was interesting to see him asking the question and the reply that followed as it appeared scripted.#WATCH | On the 'nameplates in Kanwar Yatra' issue, US State Department Spokesperson, Matthew Miller responds to a Pakistani journalist’s question, ""We have seen those reports. We have also seen the reports that the Indian Supreme Court on July 22 issued an interim stay on the… pic.twitter.com/9XcX4NliIaAli asked, “Indian media is reporting that in a few states, the BJP government is forcing Muslim owners of restaurants to display their Muslim names at their eateries, but due to growing hate against Muslims, they fear it will bring more problems for them. What are your thoughts when you see such kind of action by any government?” Ali’s emotionless read of the question from the mobile made it evident that he was not prepared to ask the question.Matthew Miller replied citing the Supreme Court’s interim stay on the directive and said, “We have seen those reports. We have also seen the reports that the Indian Supreme Court on July 22nd issued an interim stay on the implementation of those rules, so they’re not actually in effect now. Speaking generally, we are, as we always say, committed to promoting and respecting universal – promoting and protecting, I should say, universal respect for the right of freedom of religion and belief for all anywhere in the world, and we have engaged with our Indian counterparts on the importance of equal treatment for members of all religious communities.”Interestingly, Matthew Miller was all prepared to answer the question with all the facts in hand even though it is a rather trivial regular development in India and ideally, he should have restrained from commenting on it considering India-US relations. Notably, the next date in the matter has been set as 26th July by the Supreme Court of India. The reply of the US State Department’s spokesperson is now in public and it should be seen as a pressure tactic on the Indian judicial system as well as on the Government of India. So far, the Union Ministry of External Affairs has not released any statement in this regard.Curiously, Miller, who had all the details and developments regarding the order and Supreme Court’s subsequent order, did not bother to point out a glaring error in Jahanzaib Ali’s question. The directive of the UP, MP and Uttarakhand govts was for ALL the vendors and shopkeepers to display their names along the Kanwar routes, not just Muslims. The order, now stayed by the Supreme Court, was applicable on Hindu vendors too but Ali carefully phrased his question to imply only Muslim vendors were forced to display their names. It is just that only some Muslims had a problem with displaying their names in their shops. Interestingly, Jahanzaib Ali deliberately made it sound like a Muslim-specific order and Miller didn’t bother to rectify it, despite being obviously aware of the facts of the case, along with all recent developments and the Supreme Court order too. On 22nd July, the Supreme Court of India gave interim relief to petitioners against the governments of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand directive asking shopkeepers, eateries, hotels, restaurants, dhabas etc to display their names and their workers’ names prominently outside the shop. The directive that was first given by Muzaffarnagar police was to ensure the Kanwariyas did not face any problems while choosing where to buy food items in order to ensure their religious practice. However, the petitioners contended in the court that it was against the constitution and discriminatory promoting untouchability. As there was no one representing the states in the court, an interim order favouring the petitioners was passed. The next date of the hearing is 26th July. The court, however, left a window for legislative intervention.Jahanzaib Ali is originally from Pakistan. According to his LinkedIn profile, he has been associated with Pakistani channel ARY News since October 2014. His questions targetting India are well-documented.

"25 July, 2024",President Droupadi Murmu announces that Durbar Hall and Ashok Hall in Rashtrapati Bhavan have been renamed Ganatantra Mandap and Ashok Mandap,https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/durbar-hall-ashok-hall-rashtrapati-bhavan-renamed-ganatantra-ashok-mandap/,"Renaming 'Ashok Hall' as 'Ashok Mandap' brings uniformity in language and removes the traces of anglicisation while upholding the key values associated with the word 'Ashok', it added.President Droupadi Murmu announced on Thursday that two of the important halls of Rashtrapati Bhavan, namely, Durbar Hall and Ashok Hall, have been renamed as Ganatantra Mandap and Ashok Mandap, respectively, according to a President’s Secretariat release.According to the release, the renaming was part of making the ambience of the Rashtrapati Bhavan “reflective of Indian cultural values and ethos.”“Rashtrapati Bhavan, the office and residence of the President of India, is a symbol of the nation, and an invaluable heritage of the people. Continuous efforts are being made to make it more accessible to people. There has been a consistent endeavour to make the ambience of the Rashtrapati Bhavan reflective of the Indian cultural values and ethos,” the release mentioned.Durbar Hall is the venue of important ceremonies and celebrations, such as the presentation of the National Awards. The term ‘Durbar’ refers to courts and assemblies of Indian rulers and the British.The release stated that it lost relevance after India became a republic, that is, ‘Ganatantra’. The concept of ‘Ganatantra’ is deeply rooted in Indian society since ancient times, making ‘Ganatantra Mandap’ an apt name for the venue.“Ashok Hall was originally a ballroom. The word ‘Ashok’ connotes someone who is “free from all sufferings” or “bereft of any sorrow”. Also, ‘Ashoka’ refers to Emperor Ashok, a symbol of unity and peaceful coexistence. The National Emblem of the Republic of India is the lion capital of Ashok from Sarnath.

She was suspicious of Mohammad Alam as he stayed with the victim and the cops looked into the case. They apprehended and interrogated him after which he confessed to the crime and revealed that he met Pooja five years ago in the Vijaynagar area of Ghaziabad where he used to run a car mechanic shop. The two then grew closer.Pooja who had three children had separated from her husband and was living apart from him at a house in Sector 9, Vijay Nagar. The two became more intimate and eventually moved in together. Mohammad Alam’s wife Shana stayed in the village. He established an auto repair business in Noida a while after meeting the deceased. The couple got married in a Nikah ceremony at home six months ago and a few days later, she began putting pressure on him to leave his first spouse and live with her.She continuously forced him to comply which was against his wishes and hence he decided to get rid of her and planned to murder her. On 19th July she again pushed him for the same. His son was admitted to a hospital in Ghaziabad at the time and she told him to come there and meet her. Afterwards, they met outside, and the culprit took Pooja in a car. An argument broke out between the duo and he choked her to death and dumped her body in Ganga canal. He then went to the police station to submit a missing person’s complaint. The police arrested Mohammad Alam from Ghaziabad and registered a case against him after the truth was disclosed.He notified police that his wife had left the house following a fight and had turned off her phone, in the early hours of 20th July, per other media reports. On 22nd July, however, Poonam accused him of kidnapping her sister in a police complaint.Rajesh Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (city zone) unveiled that on 19th July Mohammad Alam fixed a customer’s Santro automobile and drove it to a Masoori hospital where his son was hospitalized owing to a liver infection. According to the investigation, at approximately 8:00 pm, Pooja contacted him and insisted that he return home, however, he declined and told her was going to see his kid which led to a disagreement. Pooja then informed him that she would also be visiting the hospital.He further informed, “After the second missing person complaint, police got suspicious and questioned Alam at length. He broke down and admitted to killing Devi. He told us that his son was admitted to a hospital for the past several days and Devi was pressuring him to stay with her and not visit the hospital. As a result, the two had an altercation near the hospital. At 9:30 pm, Pooja reached the hospital. Alam asked her to wait for him outside. Later, Alam took her in the Santro car towards the Ganga canal and the two kept arguing throughout their journey. Alam told us that he took Devi in a Santro car to a canal near Masoori and strangled her to death on the night of July 22. He later dumped the body in the canal.” The official added, “The suspect murdered the woman in the car on an isolated road near the canal. He dumped the body in the canal and it is yet to be recovered. We seized the car used in the crime and arrested the suspect for murder and destruction of evidence.” A First Information Report has been registered and section 140 (2) (kidnapping or abducting to murder or for ransom) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita has been invoked against him. “Police are currently trying to recover the body. Soon, the police will add BNS section 103 (punishment for murder),” stated an official. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Also, the Karnataka Legislative Council unanimously urges that the Union government should immediately exempt the state of Karnataka from examination and provide medical admission based on the Common Entrance Test (CET) conducted by the state government,” the resolution said.” Medical Education Minister Dr Sharan Prakash Patil has been continuously opposing the NEET exam by highlighting the massive irregularities and how this system was affecting the chances of underprivileged and rural students and their dream of a medical profession,” it added.On Wednesday, the ruling TMC government in West Bengal moved a resolution in the West Bengal Assembly demanding the scrapping of the NEET and restoration of the previous system of individual state governments conducting such examinations. The resolution was passed in the assembly.Earlier on Tuesday, July 23, the Supreme Court declined to cancel the NEET-UG 2024 exam, realising that giving direction for a fresh NEET-UG for the present year would be replete with serious consequences for over 24 lakh students who appeared in this exam.The apex court was hearing a batch of pleas seeking direction to recall NEET-UG 2024 results and to conduct the examination afresh, alleging paper leakage and malpractices in the test held.(This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

"25 July, 2024","Delhi High Court declines to stay release of Netflix show ‘Tribhuvan Mishra CA Topper’ on ICAI’s defamation lawsuit, read what the court said",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/delhi-hc-rejects-icai-plea-to-stay-netflix-show-tribhuvan-mishra-ca-topper/,"The court stated that it is merely the narrative of a single CA topper who also works in the sex industry. Hence, prima facie, the court is of the opinion that this show should not be banned.The Delhi High Court recently received a petition from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) seeking to prevent Netflix from releasing the series titled Tribhuvan Mishra: CA Topper. The show, which premiered on 18th July, was termed vulgar, sensationalized and disparaging of the chartered accountant profession, according to the ICAI. However, on 16th July, just two days before the series began streaming, the court refused to stay its release. ICAI and three chartered accountants had submitted the lawsuit against the release of the show’s trailer on 10th July. Dr Rohit Ruwatia Agarwal, a Central Council Member of ICAI also took to X (earlier Twitter) to inform about the legal proceedings.ICAI has filed a suit for permanent injunction at Delhi High Court for restraining Netflix from telecasting the web series defaming profession. Advocates for ICAI requested for an urgent hearing as web series is scheduled for release on 18th July & the matter will be heard…The case was heard by Judge Navin Chawla who listened to the arguments from both sides and watched the trailer after which he dismissed ICAI’s claim that the series denigrates chartered accountants (CAs) on the grounds that it does not refer to the field of chartered accounting. The court stated that it is merely the narrative of a single CA topper who also works in the sex industry. Hence, prima facie, the court is of the opinion that this show should not be banned.The court pronounced, “It is a series which appears to be more in the genre of comedy, and merely describes the main character as a topper in the Chartered Accountancy Examination. It is neither intended nor can be perceived as derogatory to the profession of Chartered Accountancy or the toppers or rank holders in the examination conducted by ICAI.” The bench emphasized that an overly sensitive approach cannot justify restricting artistic expression, especially when it takes the shape of a commercial discourse.“The artistic expression, even in the form of a commercial speech, cannot be curtailed on the basis of an oversensitive approach. I, therefore, do not find any prima facie case in favour of the plaintiffs for grant of an ad interim injunction in their favour at this stage,” the court said.The court also pointed out observations of a similar 2020 case (Ashutosh Dubey v. Netflix) of an advocate which noted that granting an ad interim injunction would amount to interfering with the defendant’s constitutionally protected right to free speech and expression as well as highlighted, “The very essence of democracy is that a creative artist is given the liberty to project the picture of the society in a manner he perceives. One of the prime forms of exposing the ills of society is by portraying a satirical picture of the same. Stand-up comedians perform that very purpose. In their portrayal, they use satire and exaggerate the ills to an extent that it becomes a ridicule. In the humorous portrayal of the ills of society, the stand-up comedians use satire.”The petitioners argued that the trailer depicted the field of chartered accounting in an incredibly crude and demeaning light. They added that ICAI had received emails protesting the trailer’s reportedly scandalous content, which included “unwarranted innuendos to the profession.” It was pointed out that the trailer’s description of the services provided by CAs as “debit and credit with reference to sexual services offered” was insulting to the field.On the other hand, Sandeep Sethi, the legal counsel representing Netflix countered that the web series is entirely fictitious and a disclaimer clarifying that the show does not allude to any specific person, living or dead, appears at the beginning of the program. The streaming giant promised to include a disclaimer asserting that the series does not depict or make reference to any profession, within the next five days.Tribhuvan Mishra CA Topper is created by Puneet Krishna, co-creator of Prime Video’s popular “Mirzapur” series. It is set in Uttar Pradesh’s Noida and features Manav Kaul, Tillotama Shome, Shweta Basu Prasad, Sumit Gulati, Faisal Malik, and Ashok Pathak. Its plot centres on an accountant who gets involved in several escapades, including working as a gigolo for a while to pay off debts. The trailer caused an immediate uproar when it was unveiled last week. Netizens and chartered accountants denounced Netflix and the producers for what they perceived as a provocative and slanderous depiction of the profession. The show, which gives little background information about its leading characters, depicts the protagonist, an honest government official who is living a normal life until financial pressure forces him into a controversial and unconventional field of work. The titular character, a chartered accountant played by Manav Kaul works as a gigolo at night to make ends meet.CA professionals demanded that the title of the series be changed, claiming that it denigrates their industry. They maintained that it was unlawful and a violation of constitutional rights to depict something in such an offensive manner. “Ridiculous, madness, and shamelessness. Nowadays, CAs are a soft target for everyone, only to earn money and defame them. Now it is time for the torchbearer to do something extraordinary so that in the future, no one can easily defame CA,” Former ICAI president C.A. Anupam Sharma complained while voicing his disapproval as he reacted to an angry tweet by another miffed chartered account. Ridiculous, madness, and shamelessness. Nowadays, CAs are a soft target for everyone, only to earn money and defame them. Now it is time for the torchbearer to do something extraordinary, so that in the future, no one can easily defame CA. @CaRANJEET @akhilpachori @CAChirag https://t.co/qephLfkucLThe series which received very little promotion has been grabbing headlines after the controversy and lawsuit filed in the Delhi High Court. ‘Boycott Tribhuvan Mishra CA Topper’ also trended on social media after its trailer was released.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.
